Hi everyone,I’m celibate, but like most guys, I’ve wondered how I compare to the average man regarding penis size. Until now though, I’d just never actually ventured to find out.After looking at some statistics, I was shocked to learn I’m significantly larger than average. Both in terms of girth and length.(I’m unsure if it would be appropriate to share the exact measurements. If that information is important, please let me know in the comments.)I have read a bit about preferred sizes for most women, and sizes that tend to cause pain. I’m really worried about sex in the future with my eventual wife. From what I gather, certain sexual acts will probably be off the table altogether. And it seems unavoidable that sex might be uncomfortable and maybe painful for her.I plan to marry a girl who has also kept herself celibate before marriage. I’m really worried that our first time together will be extremely painful. And that it could totally put her off enjoying and desiring intimacy together.I get that some level of discomfort is normal for a first time. But my situation makes me wonder if I should do anything to navigate this issue in the future.A few of my questions are:Has anyone here had a similar experience with their spouse? How did it affect what you can both do as a couple?Is there anything I or my wife could do that would improve her comfort? I’ve heard about a few things like vaginal dilation – is that ever a good idea?Should I even mention this before getting married? How would I approach that?For obvious reasons, I’m a little embarrassed to ask a family member or friend about this. But it’s something I’m pretty concerned about. I’d really appreciate any advice that you all may have – thank you in advance!
