My name is Alexa, and my husband is Mark. Together, we are the proud owners of a charming women’s clothing boutique. Our shop is a warm and inviting space. It is filled with racks upon racks of colorful garments in all shapes and sizes. We take great pleasure in assisting women of diverse body types and unique styles. We want them to feel confident and embrace their individual beauty. There is everything from elegant evening gowns to trendy streetwear. We have something for every woman to feel like the best version of herself. Our passion for fashion and empowering others shines through every aspect of our business. We work hard to make it a truly special place to shop.As we enter our mid-40s, our children have spread their wings and left the nest. Our once quiet and routine sexual relationship has transformed into something wild and passionate. Even while we’re working side by side at the store. I can’t help but notice my husband sneak glances at other women’s cleavage. Instead of feeling jealous, a thrill shoots through me. I love to know that he still has an eye for the beauty of God’s creation. His gaze lingers on curves and contours, taking in every detail with admiration and desire. And as we lock eyes, a fiery connection ignites between us. Like two flames dancing in the wind. Our love has only grown stronger with age, fueled by a deep appreciation for each other’s desires and pleasures.I was preparing for my shift at the store, when my phone lit up with a text from Mark. His instructions were specific and bold. Wear a short skirt with nothing underneath, and a revealing dress to showcase my cleavage. But that wasn’t all. He wanted me to use my expertise to help other women embrace their bodies. To help them choose outfits that would ignite desire in their husbands. The thrill and naughtiness of his requests sent shivers down my spine as I eagerly dressed for the day ahead. It was like being a secret agent on a mission to unleash sensuality and confidence in those around me.Around 11:15, a woman entered the store alone – someone I had never met before. I could tell she was seeking something, but at first, I wasn’t sure what it was. She appeared to be around 5’5 and in her mid-30s. Our eyes met, and I noticed her gaze lingering on the short dress I was wearing, highlighting my cleavage. She seemed shy and unsure about why she had stepped into our clothing store. But that only made me more intrigued. I was someone who exudes sensuality for my partner, Mark. I wanted to help her liberate herself and feel sexy for the man in her life.So, with a smile, I asked her, “What’s your story?” And she revealed that it was her anniversary. They had been married for 10 years.“Well then,” I said with a laugh, “let’s find you a dress that will knock him off his feet.”I couldn’t resist bringing my friend some new dresses that I knew her husband would adore. As we sorted through the racks, I noticed her eyes lingering on my cleavage. In a teasing tone, I asked if she wanted something to show off her own cleavage. At first, she hesitated and said no, but after a little more coaxing, she finally gave in.“Oh, I know he would love it,” she confessed with a coy smile. “He’s always had this fascination with other men admiring my body. It’s a constant battle keeping him in line.”We both laughed at the thought. I then shared with her that my husband also enjoys when other men admire me. It’s exhilarating and thrilling for both of us. Of course, that doesn’t mean we would ever cross any boundaries or betray our marriage vows. We are both devout Christians and committed to each other. But there is something undeniably empowering about knowing other men find me attractive and desirable. And the fact that it turns my husband on only adds to the excitement.Her laughter filled the room like a gentle breeze, drawing my attention to her excited expression.“Honey,” I said, “let me find something that he’s going to love and that you’ll feel incredible wearing. He wants you to be a head-turner, and I want to help you celebrate your sexuality.”As I walked towards the racks of dresses, I couldn’t ignore the subtle pulsing between my legs. This reminded me of my own arousal. I was excited to be part of this woman’s journey to ignite passion in her partner.Picking out a seductive dress for her was fun. I knew I was helping her become a more confident and sexy woman for her husband. To be honest, it turned me on. While she was at the checkout counter, I eagerly anticipated fulfilling Mark’s request of pleasuring myself to orgasm. And of course, sharing all the juicy details with him.Once my friend left, the store was empty. But I couldn’t resist the temptation and found myself becoming aroused behind the counter. With no one around, I slid my hand down to my already wet pussy. As soon as I touched my clit, a surge of electricity seemed to shoot through my entire body. That’s when I started to caress my breasts, squeezing them together with one hand. At the same time, keeping an eye out for any potential customers walking by. The thrill of potentially getting caught only added to the intensity of the moment.My one hand slowly moved away from my heaving chest, with my other fingers reaming at my damp mound. I couldn’t help but think of Mark’s suggestion to go without underwear and a bra. And use my body to help another woman find an alluring dress to boost her confidence and please her husband. The thought sent shivers down my spine. I imagined the possibilities, the thrill of being both seductive and selfless simultaneously.I’ve often wondered if other women feel the same way. I can’t help feeling turned on when I imagine wearing a dress and going out with my husband. The thought of all the men admiring me and my outfit makes me feel desired. I also can’t help but picture my husband becoming aroused by it. He is not the jealous type. And sometimes I even think he would want me to be a “hot wife” shared with other men. But as Christians, we keep these fantasies within the safety of marriage, allowing them to remain just fantasies.I find his fantasy endearing because it shows how highly he thinks of me. This in turn boosts my own self-esteem. My thoughts drift to this while I continue to pleasure myself, feeling wetter and more aroused with each stroke. Suddenly, the intensity builds, and I keep going, making sure no one walks in on me. Wave after wave washes over me as I experience a powerful orgasm. I was so grateful for my marriage and the way Mark makes me feel about myself. Our shared adventures only add to the love between us.I couldn’t wait to tell him the story, knowing it would turn him on. That night, I shared all the juicy details, and his arousal was evident. He asked me to show him what I did. So I lifted my short skirt and reenacted the scene as my hands played with myself in front of him. He watched eagerly, hungry to have me. As I approached climax, I asked if he wanted me to finish.He eagerly said yes and promised to fuck me afterward. True to his word, he then asked how I wanted to be fucked. My preferred position was on my hands and knees, doggy style. He pulled up my short skirt and took me with his impressive manhood. He made me climax once again before releasing himself inside of me. It was a powerful and satisfying sexual experience that left me wanting more, being his masturbation slut.
