The lamp steals the shadows from your naked body as I open my eyes to find you tenderly, lovingly, looking at me.  You are so willing to focus on my pleasure.  Like the sunset over the Pacific Ocean, your soft, delicious breasts lure my gaze. I am drawn to you. I look at your bare, beautiful form.  It makes me want you profusely.  I want to pour all my love into you so that it fills you up until you are shining with the energy.Lying with my back against the soft, fur rug, I tell you to get on top of me. I can feel the ecstasy of your body enveloping mine deeply.  It begins with pure physical pleasure, both of us caught up in the bliss.  Then I put my hands on your hips, and I feel your skin, warm and smooth, under my palms.  I watch your body rise and fall.The closeness of this past week bubbles over, and I can’t hold it in any longer.  I can’t contain my love for you, and it explodes through my lips as I pull you down on top of me.  How much I love you.  How much passion I have inside for you.  I love you so much.  This fuels my desire to be closer to you.  I want to hold you, to protect you, to care for you, to bring you happiness.Every emotion I feel overflows, and I want to share them with you.  I want you to resonate with the sound of my passion, the overwhelming emotion I feel when I look at you, when I touch you—a pure, honest note, seeping out of my body and drawn into yours.What have I done to deserve a woman so beautiful, so caring, and kind as you?
