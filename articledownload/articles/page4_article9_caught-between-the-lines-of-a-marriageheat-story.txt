(L) – This story contains strong language.Lauren sat curled​ up​ in the armchair, her striped robe draped loosely around her, one shoulder slipping free​ as she sank deeper into her phone. The soft glow​ of the screen illuminated her face, her lips slightly parted, eyes dark with focus.She was reading the daily​ MarriageHeat story, her breath catching​ at specific passages, the words weaving​ a delicious tension through her body. Heat coiled low​ in her stomach, and she shifted slightly, pressing her thighs together, wholly absorbed​ in the unfolding scene.Lauren exhaled slowly, her fingers tightening around the phone​ as the story’s tension built, each word sending another wave​ of heat coursing through her. She shifted​ in the chair, the ache between her thighs growing insistent, the familiar pulse​ of need impossible​ to ignore. Her gaze flickered away from the screen momentarily, scanning the room. She was alone. Joe was still out. The apartment was silent except for the clock’s rhythmic ticking and the faint hum​ of Paris beyond the window.Her breath hitched​ as she let the thought settle.​ No one​ to interrupt,​ no one​ to hear. Just her, the teasing heat​ of the​ MH story playing​ in her mind, and the growing temptation​ to fully enjoy the effect​ it was having​ on her body.​ A slow smile tugged​ at her lips​ as she set the phone aside, already knowing exactly what she wanted.Driven​ by​ a sudden, irresistible need, Lauren rose from the chair, her movements swift and purposeful. She padded across the room, her bare feet silent against the floor​ as she made her way​ to the bedside table. With​ a glance toward the door—still alone—she pulled open the drawer, her fingers closing around the familiar shape​ of her favourite toy.Heart pounding, she wasted​ no time, slipping​ it into her hand​ as she turned back toward the armchair. The anticipation thrummed through her, making her movements quicker and more urgent. She curled back into her seat, the phone waiting, the story still unfolding. Now, she was ready​ to enjoy​ it properly.She opened her legs and switched the mini wand​ to the low setting​ as she read. Her breath caught​ as the vibrations teased through the thin fabric​ of her grey panties. She let out​ a shaky moan, her fingers clenching reflexively around the phone, her eyes squeezing shut.Lauren bit her lip, her head falling back, her thoughts​ a swirling, dizzying haze​ of MH’s words and her desperate desire. She pressed the toy closer, the pulsing vibrations sinking deep into her, pulling​ a strangled gasp from her throat. With every word she read, she felt the sensations grow deep inside her. The toy buzzed insistently between her legs, the pleasure rippling through her. She moaned louder now, her hips shifting​ as the ache between her thighs grew sharper, the sensation​ of the wand’s steady pulse​ sо good, yet not enough. She was panting now, her pulse racing, her chest rising and falling with quick, shallow breaths. She slid the wand along her slit over her panties, whimpering softly​ as the dark wet patch spread over the fabric.Joe returned from his weekend run, the lingering rush​ of adrenaline making his breath steady​ as​ he padded into the apartment.​ He moved toward the bedroom, expecting​ to find Lauren curled​ up with her Kindle, but​ he stopped​ as​ he passed the doorway.She hadn’t heard him come in. She hadn’t noticed him standing there, watching.Lauren sat​ in the armchair, her robe loose around her body, head tilted back, eyes closed. One hand gripped her phone, cupping her breast. The glow​ of the screen cast shadows over her nipples. The other hand held​ a toy, its gentle hum filling the silence, her chest’s slow rise and fall betraying the pleasure coursing through her.Joe exhaled,​ a smirk tugging​ at his lips. Watching her lost​ in her world excited him, and​ he reached down​ to adjust himself, feeling his erection straining against his shorts.Lauren let out​ a soft moan, her fingers clutching the wand more tightly​ as the toy’s steady buzz sank deeper into her core. She rolled her hips, chasing the sensations, the movement sending​ a rush​ of heat flooding through her. She needed more. Now.Lauren’s fingers pulled the fabric​ of the panties​ to one side, and she opened her eyes​ to press the toy against her wet clit.She was initially startled​ to see Joe standing​ at the doorway, his hand​ in his shorts, pulling​ at his hard cock. She smiled and, without losing​ a breath, tilted her head back, closed her eyes and continued​ to guide the toy over her sopping mound.Lauren’s breath caught, her heart pounding. The knowledge that​ he was watching her was exhilarating. She was wet, aching and needy. Her clit throbbed beneath the toy, the steady pulse shooting sparks through her. Her back arched, her hips lifting from the chair​ as she circled the vibrator against her, drawing​ it lower, teasing her entrance. The pressure was incredible. Her breath came faster, her hips bucking instinctively, her fingers tightening their grip.A strangled moan tore from her throat​ as she pushed the toy into her, its buzzing head sinking deep inside her, filling her completely. She whimpered. Her free hand dropped the phone and moved​ to her breast, fingers finding her nipple. The soft fabric​ of the robe rubbed against her sensitive flesh​ as she kneaded the swell​ of her breast, the touch sending jolts​ of pleasure through her.Joe stood, his mouth dry, eyes locked​ on the sight​ of his beautiful wife pleasuring herself. His gaze roamed over her, the flush rising​ on her cheeks, her soft moans, the gentle sway​ of her hips. Her robe had slipped off her shoulders, baring her chest, her nipples stiff.​ He could tell how wet she was, could almost smell the intoxicating scent​ of her fragrance, her wet panties pulled​ to one side.Joe approached her and knelt between his wife’s open legs.​ He placed his hands​ on her knees and leaned forward. “You’re beautiful.”Lauren opened her eyes, the sound​ of Joe’s voice catching her breath. She watched​ as​ he lifted her free hand​ to his lips.Joe placed​ a soft kiss​ on her palm, then guided her hand​ to back her breast.He leaned closer, his breath hot against her skin. “Play with your nipples, baby.​ I want​ to see you.”Lauren shivered​ at his words, her head spinning, her whole body tingling with pleasure. She obeyed him instantly, her fingers circling her nipple, drawing​ it gently, pinching​ it between her thumb and finger.Joe took hold​ of the toy and guided​ it​ up towards her clit. She felt the speed increase​ as​ it buzzed over her hard pea. Joe lowered the toy back​ to her hole and then lowered his mouth​ to her. His tongue flicked over her. Then​ he sucked her clit gently into his mouth.​ He began​ to lick her clit slowly, swirling his tongue around her nub, feeling her shiver beneath him.Lauren let out​ a shuddering sigh, the toy’s steady hum intensifying the waves​ of pleasure radiating through her. Joe’s tongue traced circles around her swollen bud, his mouth hot and insistent. She gasped, her hips jerking forward, her back arching, her head falling back. The heat was unbearable, her skin flushed, her breaths coming quick and ragged. She clutched desperately​ at the chair, her fingers digging into the upholstery. She needed this release. She needed​ it now.“Don’t stop.” Lauren’s voice was hoarse, her body tense. “Please, don’t stop.”Joe lifted his head, his mouth still glistening, and smirked​ up​ at her.​ “I love seeing you like this.”“Joe…” Lauren’s breath caught,​ a pleading edge​ to her voice.​ “I need​ to cum.”He took hold​ of the wand and pressed​ it against her, the steady buzz​ of the toy sinking into her, the pressure exquisite.“Fuck!” She moaned.Her body sank into the soft surface​ of the armchair beneath her. Her hands gripped her knees, pulling them close​ to her chest, her fingernails pressing lightly into her skin. Her thighs open, allowing Joe​ to enjoy her heat.​ As Joe looked​ up​ at Lauren’s face, the position accentuated the curve​ of her body,​ a mix​ of comfort and quiet vulnerability. She bucked against his tongue that lapped ferociously​ at her clit. Her legs began​ to tremble, the pleasure building inside her, the heat spreading through her.“That’s it,” Joe said. “Just let go.”“Oh​ my God!”The tension broke, and she orgasmed with​ a cry, her whole body shuddering, her eyes squeezing shut. Wave after wave​ of pleasure crashed through her, the release sweeping over her, drowning her. She fell back into the chair, gasping, her body trembling.Joe leaned back​ on his ankles and looked​ at Lauren’s glowing face.“Who were you reading?”​ he asked“Your favourite​ MH author,” she said, her head lolling​ to one side.“Did you finish the story?”“No.”“Read​ it​ to me,”​ he saidAs Lauren began​ to read, Joe knelt and positioned his cock against her cunt.​ He pushed​ in slowly, savouring the sensation​ of her tight, wet walls engulfing his member. She was dripping with need, her inner walls slick and silky, her heat radiating through him.​ He moaned​ as her tightness gripped his shaft, her inner muscles fluttering around him, squeezing him, drawing him deeper.As she read,​ he began​ to move, rocking his hips slowly, pulling almost all the way out before sliding back into her, pushing her harder against the armchair, her body shaking. The pleasure intensified​ as she wrapped her legs around his body. They both sensed the overwhelming feeling​ as​ he glided​ in and out​ of her.​ He could feel her push back against him​ as the story worked its magic​ on her again. The walls​ of her pussy clenching around him, the friction​ of his cock sending sparks through her.As she continued​ to read, Joe moved quicker, driving into her harder, the sound​ of his balls slapping against hers filling the air. She panted, her words tumbling from her lips, the story barely audible over their ragged breaths.“Fuck me, that’s it,”​ he growled, his hips rolling against her.She whimpered, her nails digging into his skin, her breath catching, her body arching into him.​ He reached between their bodies and stroked her clit.Lauren’s body shuddered, her muscles tensing. The pleasure coiled tighter, threatening​ to overwhelm her. Her legs tightened around his hips, her heels digging into his ass, urging him deeper.“Keep reading,”​ he asked.She struggled​ to form the words, her brain clouded​ by the waves​ of pleasure crashing over her. She panted, her words stuttering, her breathing erratic. But she did not stop reading.“You’re​ sо fucking sexy,”​ he groaned.He moved his hand​ to her breasts, kneading the soft flesh, pinching her nipples.​ He watched her squirm beneath him, her body writhing, her hips rolling, her eyes fluttering closed.“Eyes​ on the phone,”​ he said.She moaned, her gaze dropping​ to the screen, her breath coming​ in short gasps.“Keep going.”“Joe,​ I can’t…”“Yes, you can. Keep reading.”He increased his pace, his hips thrusting into her, his cock filling her.She tried, but her mind was spinning, and the sensations were too intense. She could barely think, let alone speak.“Read,”​ he said, his voice low and commanding.Her eyes fluttered open, meeting his, her breath hitching.“Do​ as you’re told.”The words were barely audible, her voice​ a whisper. But​ he heard them.He leaned closer, his mouth hovering just above hers, his eyes burning into her.Lauren read the final words, “He pulled out and orgasmed over her face.”He exploded inside her, his cock pulsing, his seed spilling into her. The sensation rippled through her, and her body convulsed around him. Her second orgasm was​ as violent and loud​ as the first.He collapsed against her, his cock twitching inside her​ as she wrapped her arms around him, their bodies trembling.They lay silently for​ a moment, their panting breaths filling the air. Lauren smiled and closed her eyes, content​ to lie there, her husband still buried deep inside her.“We should leave​ a comment and say thank you,” Joe said, his voice muffled against her neck.“Mmm,​ or​ we could write​ it​ up and share it,” Lauren said, her eyes still closed. “It might inspire others​ to​ do the same,” she said.“How hot would​ it​ be​ to know​ we made someone else​ do the same?”​ he teased.**********So here’s your invitation.
