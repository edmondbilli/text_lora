Hey my dear MH family! Sorry this has taken so long, but I just wanted to say thank you so very much for the prayers and support I received from everyone during my recent illness.I am doing very well and feeling a whole lot better. It touched me very deeply when I was told of all the prayers and support I was recieving here at MH and SOTB ( of which I am no longer a member).I want to thank Missy and Calvin and everyone here at MH. I truly appreciate it very much. Just saying thank you just doesn’t seem to be enough to say. So God bless each and every one of ya’ll.I am so very blessed to have an awesome family. All of which have gone above and beyond to take so very good care of me. Thank you to my awesome husband Ben who has been my rock and tried his best to keep all informed. I love you so very much! A big thank you to my three awesome kiddos who took time out of their lives to come and support their momma. I love you each to the moon and back.Told myself I wouldn’t, but this ol’ Tennessee country girl has tears running down her cheeks as I type this.Looking forward to sharing many more stories, as well as enjoying all of yours.
