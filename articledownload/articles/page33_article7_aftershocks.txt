I’ve noticed both recently and in the past, that sometimes my Mary experiences what I call aftershocks. Sort of mini-orgasms after we’ve concluded our intimate time together. She experiences multiple orgasms during our interactive play-time, of various intensities. Her response appears to build in intensity when she comes, until she has the Big One. She lifts her bottom off the bed, clenches her thighs tightly together, and pulls away from whatever stimuli I’m providing. So intense. She jerks spasmodically in strong orgasmic release until she’s finished. There is (infrequently) a slight squirt or heavy gush of fluid with her release.If I reapply massage or a toy, the process repeats. Subsequent orgasms may be weaker, or as strong as the strongest one experienced. After our play time has completed, we lie beside one another in post-orgasmic bliss. I may reach over and touch her thigh, or stomach, and she starts jumping around again. It’s as if she’s experiencing another mini-orgasm and begins laughing. She doesn’t initiate further physical contact, but usually responds “I love you.” and “You make me feel so good.” Then quickly falls into a deep sleep. I have noticed she seems to sleep later / longer after we’ve had a vigorous  engagement the night before.Her response has made me curious.Have others here also experienced these, what I call , ” aftershocks”?
