Thank you all for your participation and input through out MH. Awesome content here. Many of you have made reference to using coconut oil and it has intrigued my interest in trying it. I have looked in stores, not really knowing quite where to look. I have looked in areas of health and beauty aids to pharmacy area to that of groceries as to where you would find olive oil and the like with no success. Please forgive my ignorance, could someone help a brother out? I really don’t want to tell store personnel what I want coconut oil for. I guess I wouldn’t feel this way if I were shopping at the toy store where these conversations are a bit more the norm. Thanks in advance for your help. Keep it hot.
