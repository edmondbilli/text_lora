Good morning, MarriageHeat Community!I’m hoping some of y’all would be willing to share how you bring up sexual concerns in your marriage. Do you have a standing check-in date? A specific location? How do you even start?My husband is very quick to perceive anything less than perfection as complete failure. I have to be VERY careful how I verbalize anything to him, especially anything that could be taken as criticism. This sensitivity is magnified when the topic is sexual. My problem-solving, direct way of speaking is almost always too abrupt for him. It’s taken years of marriage for us to understand this about each other.There is a specific sexual act I’d like from him that I want to discuss. It is something he’s done several times before, but hasn’t now in a few years. I don’t know why he stopped. Does he not like doing that anymore? Does he just not want to? Is it something else?I REALLY would like more of this! But I hate to make him feel like he’s not doing enough as is or cause him to shut down.  I also don’t want to guilt him into something he doesn’t want to do. And neither do I want to beg.Does anyone else have a very sensitive spouse? How do you approach something that may sound like a criticism or open up dialogue about sex?
