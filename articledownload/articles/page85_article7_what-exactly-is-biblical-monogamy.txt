[This post was submitted as a suggestion on the Add Your Ideas page. We thought it was a good candidate for discussion, so we adapted it as a stand-alone post, crediting the suggesting party. – MH]MH readers, I have a question related directly to the stories here. MarriageHeat states in its guidelines that posts are meant to support and uphold “Hot Biblical Monogamy.” But what is that exactly? How do we define it? Is monogamy having only one wife ever or just one wife at a time? Does it require a marriage license or simply a commitment (private or public) to one person?Many of us practice serial monogamy by choice or due to the death of a spouse. I think that as we now have more and more partners in life, we need to examine what makes the difference, biblically speaking. Is the true wrong actually cheating? Is it sex without a license?We are to believe God sent a worldwide flood to kill almost everyone for the sin of violence and rained down fire and brimstone that killed many for the sexual sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, yet did nothing when kings had hundreds of wives and as many or more concubines. If all sins are equal, why was the wrath of God so different? Are kings and the wealthy held to a different standard? Maybe, as some think, sex is not a sin when it’s not with your one-and-only spouse if you can afford to take care of a possible resulting child or cure an STD.Remember, the Roman Catholic Church once said one sex partner for life. Later, once you’d consummated your marriage, it was for lifeunlessyou could pay for and convince a tribunal that you deserved an annulment. Things change.Don’t get me wrong; I think it’s important to make sex hot for couples. I just think they can decide what that relationship involves.
