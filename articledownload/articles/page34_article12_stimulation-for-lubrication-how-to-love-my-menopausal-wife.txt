Hello, Everyone!I have been reading your stories for nigh on a decade,  and now I come in need of veteran wisdom.By the grace of God,  my wife beat a vicious form of leukemia, but the treatment threw her straight into menopause.  Now,  making love is a frightening prospect for her because her body is so slow to lubricate and synthetic lubes cause a burning sensation.  Coconut oil is pleasant,  but she still hurts a lot afterwards.  I would love stories of success and failure both to help me think through the hormonal and physical challenges to our coming together.Earnestly,Christmas
