“Ode To My Wife’s Boobies”A multi-limerick poemMy wife has magnificent breasts.To me, they are clearly the best.They are full and they’re round,And so, pound for pound,They really outshine all the rest.I still draw nudes—it is true.So really, I’ve seen quite a fewOf quite beautiful breastsOn lovely female chests,But Melodie’s are my perfect two.Those two boobies I get to love on,And over them, I will always fawn’Cause they’re tasty and sweetSmeared with our favorite treatOf cum from her pussy rubbed on,Cum from incredible sex.I honestly can’t guess what is next.She’s done much in the past,Even night before last,When she sent me an erotic text.Her nipples are so very, veryHard and firm like a ripe raspberry,And when covered with cum,I just have to have some,Especially flavor: StrawberryI love her boobies all of the timeBare or covered with our cummy slimeI just love to lick ‘emWith my rod, I’ll flick themAnd tell you about them in this rhymeIf it takes her a while to climaxShe knows she does not need to ask.Gladly, I’ll titillateHer nipples so greatTill she’s satisfied to the max.On our honeymoon we discoveredWhen first we went under the coversThat my little man nipsReally do kind of flipMe out when they’re licked by my lover.I love seeing her shape in her clothesAnd especially when she will poseIn cupless lingerie,Her full breasts on display.She’s beautiful from head to toes.She does not know of her great beautyBut I’ll tell you she’s a real cutieWith her Norwegian curvesAnd soft smooth skin that servesAs my treat. Loving her’s my fun duty.She also has big Nordic eyesAnd a sexy look that always lies.When we’re having sexy funAnd she’s about to cum,Then she looks like she’s just twenty-fiveI say the word “lies” ’cause when turned onHer facial lines will always be goneShe looks so very youngIn my mind I am flungBack to of our sexy marriage – the dawnI’ll get back to my ode to her boobsI really like rubbing them with lubeHer aroused boobies sayAs they swell in that wayThat I should slide in her wet pussy’s tubeAn important thing that I should say:She treats me so kindly each dayThat it’s easy to seeThat she really loves me,And I love her back in every wayNow this stanza comes to my mind:My sexy wife is really the kindWho uses her boobs well.My erection does swellWhen on each lovely nipple I’ve dined.Another verse to my sexy poem:When my eyes over her body roamHer voluptuous bodSent to me from God,Being with her’s a feeling of HomeBecause her kindness matters the most,I do not think it a boastTo say she’s my friendWith great boobs and rear end.Loveless sex is like unbuttered toast.But with kindness and love sex is great!I love making love to my sweet mateAnd to her sexy breastsIn our cozy love nest,And God put us together, not fate.Of marital passion God approvesTo all of the husbands, it behoovesUs to love our wife’s eyes(See Proverbs chapter five)And rejoice in our wife’s sexy boobsBut also be in love with her soul.A happy wife’s my number one goal.I respect my wife’s mind,And I strive to be kind.“Her lover” is my favorite role,The best calling in my long life.In spite of challenges and strife,I get to love her breastsAnd her cute body lestI forget peace that comes from my wife.Also, peace comes from our divine Lord,From us reading together His word.We are true to the faithAnd we accept His graceAnd, to heaven, we do look forward.We believe we’ll be together there‘Cause we think that our Savior is fairSo as we go through lifeAnd live as Man and WifeThen always for each other, we’ll care.Emma said to her husband, her fearThat she wanted him in heaven near.She just couldn’t bearHeaven without him there.I feel the same way about my dear.Some commentary: I’ll try to keep the explanation brief since the poem was so long.Mentioned more than once in the poem is that I like to scoop my cum, her juices, and our flavored lube from my wife’s pussy and rub it on her nipples. We use Aloe Cadabra lube—often the Naked Strawberry flavor—along with some coconut oil, so our cummy protein shake is rather tasty, in my opinion. For regular readers, you’ll already have known about that. We know that is not everyone’s thing, but it works for us. We’ve only done that for about the last 10 years of our marriage.My wife seems to “youthen” when aroused. That’s a nice blessing for me – as you can imagine. Melodie enjoys how crazy passionate her beautiful appearance makes me. Of course, I find her gorgeous all of the time, but there is something amazing about her appearance during sexual arousal.  I should add that she is lovely all of the time.  Just this week, her physical therapist and her hairdresser thought she was ten or twenty years younger than her actual age.Melodie and I believe that marriage can continue into the next life. Whether you believe that or not, I suspect that you can relate to Emma Darwin, who believed that she and her husband Charles could be together in heaven. Charles Darwin was an agnostic but not an atheist. (I’m not trying to start controversy by mentioning any of this. We really are scientists AND people with a strong faith in our Savior Jesus Christ.)I suspect that most people of faith expect to be with their loved ones in heaven.  If you don’t believe in marriage in the next life, that does not offend me.  We hope that our belief in the continuation of marriage after death does not offend you.  Maybe you DO believe in relationships and friendships going on into the next life.  In our opinion, our faith, the wisdom we have developed, our knowledge we have gained, and our friendships/relationships with others are the only things any of us take with us into the next life.
