Hello, friends!I feel desperate. My husband and I have been married for two years, and the bedroom is dead.We currently are only intimate about once every other week, if that. When we are intimate, it’s very brief with very little excitement. My husband says he’s attracted to me, but it just doesn’t feel like it most days.We are both in our twenties with no health issues, and there are no testosterone issues; this has been checked. I don’t believe he masturbates at all, and I’ve never had a concern of him going outside the marriage.We are in counseling, have been in counseling, and this has not helped this area at all. I’ve tried talking with my husband what feels like a million times. It seems there’s just an ongoing promise that it’s going to get better, and it doesn’t. This has been going on a lot of our marriage.We don’t have really any other issues, but I am struggling so bad. I feel like a weirdo wife with a high desire and am repeatedly rejected or just seen as a roommate.I’m struggling and have even fallen into masturbation as some sort of relief. He has only ever known about this once and was disgusted.  I feel like an animal, and I don’t know what to do.I’m at a loss as to how to pray. I have prayed the entire time that our sex life could be reignited. It doesn’t appear that is going to happen. I’ve resorted to trying to pray to just have my libido completely taken away but that has not worked either. I at one point was on two medications that typically decrease sex drive, and still had the same issues. I just don’t know what to do.Any and all advice is appreciated.
