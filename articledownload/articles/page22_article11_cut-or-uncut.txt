Another topic concerning male anatomy has been on my mind and I wanted to open a discussion about it.The topic is circumcision.  I have no idea what the medical/health reasons are for doing it or not doing it, and I’ve heard arguments from both sides.Personally, I like the look of a circumcised penis.  It’s more…exposed, if that makes sense, and that makes it sexy.  I would like my future husband to be cut, though it’s not a requirement.I need some education here and I’d love to get the perspective from my brothers here on MH.Additional thoughts from MH:This is a tricky subject. There are lots of factors that come into play: theological, biblical, medical, parental, sexual, and more. All of these aspects are valuable to discuss, andshouldbe carefully discussed when dealing with a practice that permanently alters the human body that God designed. However, because of the potential for strong and opposing opinions, we ask that the focus of this post be kept to the impact of circumcision on marital sex, and each spouse’s personal experiences—the men’s especially, but also the women’s. (For that reason, we’ve narrowed the scope of some of the questions listed in this post. Sorry, LLL, if that results in a narrower set of responses than you were hoping for.)
