I’ve been certain for several years now that I don’t want or have the calling to have kids. It’s just not in my nature or personality and doesn’t fit into the other things the Lord clearly wants me doing. Plus, health problems make me cautious. And I have come to view marriage as its own mission, its own ministry. If I marry, my goal will be supporting, loving, and helping my husband as we serve the Lord together. That’s major and I would focus on that.So If I get married, I plan to practice Natural Family Planning (NFP) and Fertility Awareness-based Methods of birth control. My prayer is that God will send me a man who feels the same way and is not feeling led to have children. Personally, if either I or my future husband was somehow infertile, it seems it would make things easier.I have a question: is a vasectomy 100% effective at preventing pregnancy? If so, I would consider marrying a guy who had that procedure. Have any of the men on here taken that route? What do you ladies think? Does it increase the opportunities for intimacy or lessen them? I’d love to learn more and better understand sex between a couple who are childless. Thank you!
