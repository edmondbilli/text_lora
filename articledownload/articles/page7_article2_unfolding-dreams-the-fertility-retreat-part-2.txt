ReadPart 1 of the story here.Andrew and Charlotte slipped away from the group during the break, their heads still buzzing with embarrassment and curiosity after Mariana’s provocative group session.The meadow behind the wellness center was quiet, save for the rustle of leaves in the breeze. They followed a shaded trail, the sunlight dappling the ground, until they found a wooden bridge spanning a brook. It was the perfect place to talk—or not talk, if the mood demanded it.For a while, they sat in silence, legs dangling over the water, listening to the soft gurgle of the stream below. Andrew held the list of scheduled activities, pretending to read it. Free swim, yoga, a campfire—it all felt mundane compared to what they’d just been through. He didn’t know where to start, and judging by Charlotte’s faraway look, she didn’t either.Finally, she broke the silence. “So…” She hesitated, glancing at him. “Did you want to talk about… what Mariana asked?”Andrew stiffened, his nerves already frayed. He’d been dreading this. Sharing fantasies was one thing when it came to Charlotte’s—the one she’d confessed earlier was sweet and involved him. But his? He wasn’t sure how to explain his without risking jealousy or anger.“Uh… sure,” he muttered, though he immediately regretted it.Charlotte shifted to face him, her expression both curious and concerned. “Okay. So… what do you fantasize about?”“I don’t know,” he replied quickly. Too quickly. He kept his eyes on the list, pretending it demanded all his focus. “Not much, really. I guess I just think about us… like, that time in Vermont, in the hotel room.”Charlotte frowned slightly, tilting her head. “Really? That’s it? You don’t imagine… I don’t know… other scenarios?”He felt her gaze on him, unrelenting. “No, not really.”“That’s not true,” she said, softly but firmly. “Come on, Andrew. Everyone has fantasies. You must have thought about something at some point.”He shifted uncomfortably, unsure how to answer. Charlotte sighed, sensing his hesitation. “Okay, how about this,” she offered. “What did you fantasize about before we met? That’s safe, right?”Andrew blinked. He hadn’t expected that angle. It felt like a lifeline—a way to share something without risking judgment. “Uh… before we met?”She nodded, giving him an encouraging smile.“Well…” He scratched the back of his neck, still reluctant but feeling her patience would hold. “You know I was on the swim team in high school, right?”“Yeah,” Charlotte said, intrigued. “You mentioned it.”“When I got to college, I tried out for the team again. Didn’t make it, but I kept going to the pool to train, you know, just in case. Anyway, one day, after practice, one of the guys said something that… stuck with me.”“What did he say?” Charlotte leaned forward, clearly invested now.Andrew hesitated, his cheeks flushing slightly. “He said there was a time—like, way back—when schools made students swim naked.”Charlotte blinked, her brow furrowing. “Wait, seriously? That was a thing?”“Yeah,” Andrew said, his voice a little more animated now that he was on safer ground. “I went home and looked it up. Apparently, it was true—at least in some places. There were even photos, old black-and-white ones.”Charlotte’s eyebrows shot up. “And… you fantasized about that?”Andrew shrugged, trying to play it cool. “I guess. I just… imagined what it would’ve been like.”Charlotte tilted her head. “What did you imagine, exactly?”Andrew laughed nervously, his face reddening again. “I don’t know if I should say…”“Oh, come on,” she teased, giving him a playful nudge. “I shared mine. It’s only fair.”He sighed, finally giving in. “Okay, fine. I imagined what it’d be like to walk out of the locker room naked, with all the guys, knowing the girls were doing the same. Like, how nervous I’d be, but also… how exciting it’d be to see them.”Charlotte blinked, surprised by his honesty. “All the girls? Naked?”“Yeah,” Andrew admitted, his voice quieter now. “I’d picture them coming out of the locker room, all embarrassed but trying to act like it wasn’t a big deal. And, uh… I’d try not to stare, but, you know…”“You’d sneak peeks,” Charlotte finished, smirking.“Well, yeah,” Andrew said sheepishly. “I mean, who wouldn’t?”Charlotte chuckled, shaking her head. “I can’t believe you never told me this before.”“I didn’t think it’d ever come up,” Andrew said with a laugh. He glanced at her, nervous again. “You’re not… mad, are you?”“Mad?” Charlotte shook her head, still smiling. “No, I’m just surprised. I guess I never thought about you having fantasies like that. But… it’s kind of cute, actually.”“Cute?” Andrew repeated, raising an eyebrow.“Yeah,” she said, her smile softening. “I mean, if I’d heard about naked swimming back then, I probably would’ve thought about it too.”Andrew stared at her, genuinely surprised. “Really?”“Yeah,” she admitted, her cheeks turning pink. “I’d have been terrified, but… curious.”He smiled, feeling a rush of relief—and something else. “So… what would you have done? If you were one of those girls?”Charlotte laughed nervously. “Oh, God, I don’t know. Probably tried to cover myself up as much as possible. I’d be mortified.”“But you’d still look,” Andrew teased.“Of course,” she shot back, grinning. “I’d have to know what the guys looked like. You know, for… comparison.”Andrew laughed, feeling more at ease now. “And what if you saw me?”Charlotte’s grin widened. “Well, I guess I’d have to sneak a peek at you too.”They laughed together, the tension between them melting away. For a moment, they simply sat in comfortable silence, the sound of the brook filling the space between them.After a while, Charlotte glanced at him again, her expression thoughtful. “You know… it’s kind of nice, talking about this stuff.”“Yeah,” Andrew agreed, surprised by how much lighter he felt. “It is.”Charlotte smiled, then looked down at the water. “So… what else did you imagine?”Andrew hesitated, then decided to go for it. “There was this one girl I made up. She wasn’t real, just… the token girl I liked. I’d imagine her swimming laps, getting out of the pool, her body all wet and…”“And?” Charlotte prompted, raising an eyebrow.“And… bouncing,” he finished awkwardly.Charlotte burst out laughing. “Oh my God, Andrew! You’re such a guy.”“Hey, it’s a fantasy!” he protested, laughing along with her.“And then what?” she teased. “You just stared at her?”“Well… no,” Andrew admitted, his face turning red again. “We’d, uh… have sex. By the pool.”Charlotte nearly doubled over with laughter. “You went from sneaking peeks to having sex in, like, thirty seconds!”“It’s a fantasy,” Andrew repeated, grinning. “It’s not supposed to make sense.”Charlotte shook her head, still laughing. “You’re ridiculous.”“Maybe,” he said, smiling at her. “But you’re smiling, so I’ll take it.”She rolled her eyes but couldn’t hide her grin. “Fine. It’s kind of… sweet. In a weird way.”They sat together a while longer, the air between them lighter now. Charlotte found herself thinking about Andrew’s fantasy, picturing herself in his place. The idea of walking out of a locker room naked, with boys staring at her, was both embarrassing and oddly exciting. She wondered if Andrew had felt the same way earlier, during the session with Mariana.As they made their way back to the group, Andrew glanced at Charlotte, a playful smirk on his face. “You know… I think I know where I’m taking you on our next vacation.”“Oh?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.“Somewhere with skinny-dipping,” he said, leaning in to kiss her.Charlotte laughed, dodging him. “We’ll see about that.”Andrew chased her through the meadow, both of them laughing like kids again. By the time they returned to the wellness center, they felt closer than ever, ready to face whatever came next—together.If you enjoyed this story and would like to support the site in a small way, here is a link to something fun you might consider.
