I’d like to share a bit of personal testimony with you, my MH family.It’s December 2024 as I write this, and I’ve had a several-month-long struggle with a return of depression which has interfered with my sexual journey.  It may be a while before I feel the full interest and excitement that I had up to this October, but I have a lot of hope.  God has been very close to me, showing me His tenderness in ways that I can only experience while in the depths, and revealing that His intimacy is what I need above all else.I am doing better each day as I continue the protocol to address the condition I’ve been diagnosed with.  Yet there remain some strange sensations.  It’s hard to explain what I’m feeling; there seems to be a mental veil between me and the world around me.  My brain is taking in information incorrectly, rendering people and faces unreal to my perception.  This is due to neuro-inflammation, and will, I am certain, be healed as I tackle the root cause.  I’m really thankful that I finally have a diagnosis and a doctor who is addressing it naturally.I’m thankful for the intimacy I’ve had with the Lord as I fill my mind with His Word nonstop and commit my way to Him, trusting Him to bring it to pass.  And I am so thankful to everyone here, for your prayers, your encouragement, and your kind comments on my stories.  I pray I will feel awesome in the near future and get back into this circle with wholehearted energy and spice.  You’re all such blessings!
