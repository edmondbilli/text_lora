This story is the second of three related companion stories (“A Husband’s Ticklish Discovery,” “A Wife’s Ticklishness Explored,” and “Another Ticklish Area Discovered.”) Read in order, all three illustrate how we came to realize I have an affinity for sensual tickling during our foreplay and lovemaking (me much more so than my wife.)  It took a while to collect and organize all the memories, as they happened earlier in our marriage and over a few months to years.  The introductions are the same between the three stories, just in case someone reads them out of order.  Anyway, they were enjoyable to remember, recount, and of course, to experience as a married couple.IntroductionMy wife and I have been married for 40-some years.  Sometime early in our marriage, we discovered that I am very sensitive to my wife’s light, feathery, tickling touch on non-sexual areas of my body like my back or sides.  Her special light touch creates a tingling sensation that increases my libido and the sensitivity of my other erogenous zones.  I find that touch to be VERY arousing.  Now, my wife does not respond the same way to light touches on non-erogenous areas but, once aroused, does enjoy light tickling touches on her private parts.Brief episodes of harder tickling (grabbing, poking and prodding) on my ribs, legs and sides serve to increase my libido as well. An especially reactive spot for me is the creases on the back of each thigh just below my butt cheeks. My wife discovered this area one night while we making love in the missionary position.  As we were going at it, she dug her fingers into my butt creases to pull me closer.  That sent an intense, arousing tickling sensation right to my loins, and the effect on my erection was incredible! Our sexual satisfaction was very much increased that night, and since that discovery, my wife uses that special knowledge to regularly add spice to our already incredible orgasms.Janet’s butt creases are also extremely sensitive to firm grabbing and prodding but in a rather negative way.  Early in our marriage, I playfully “goosed” my wife’s buttocks, thinking it would lead to sexual arousal. (I didn’t do it very hard.)  Her reaction to this unexpected tickle play was quite extreme and involved angry protests, kicking, and when I didn’t stop, hitting at my arms and hands to stop!   I honestly didn’t realize that to her, hard tickling in her most vulnerable spot was so intense that it really was true torture to her!  I apologized, and we made up, then established some boundaries on that particular activity so I didn’t repeat my mistake.But, as I have since discovered, even though Janet does not ALWAYS share the same level of enjoyment from tickling, there are times when she CAN be receptive to this type of foreplay.This story illustrates the first time I was given the chance to explore my wife’s sensitivities in this particular area of our love life.A Wife’s Ticklishness ExploredOne weekend morning,  my wife and I were getting ready to go out for brunch with our adult children.  Fortunately, time was running short. (That’s not a typo.)  Janet was already in the shower when I suggested we wash up together to save time and water.  I will say in all honesty, showering together doesn’t always save time or water, depending on whether we get involved in some watery married fun!  I knew we didn’t have much time for extended play, but I don’t believe in wasting an opportunity to gaze at your spouse’s naked form.  You never know what might happen!  You may have a chance to “plant a seed” that grows during the day and “blossoms” in the evening.  I LOVE this type of gardening.I washed quickly so I could spend some time gazing at my wife’s wet body.  Janet’s arms were up as she washed her hair, which left her front side defenseless against my ravenous eyes.  Her large breasts hung down, gravity shaping them into elliptical torpedoes of pale flesh on proud display before me.  Her pink nipples arose from the front lower curves of her globes.  The sight of rivulets of hot water sensually following my wife’s wonderful body entranced me.  I studied those droplets as they made their way down to either drip off the end of my wife’s breasts and turgid nipples or follow a path to her pelvis and legs.My jealousy of the water getting to taste Janet’s gorgeous body was too much for me to endure!  I leaned in toward my wife’s torso and began lightly kissing the skin of her collarbones before following the same path as the water droplets.  My lips and tongue trailed downward, between and all over her silky smooth breasts.  I brushed against each nipple with my lips and gave each one a firm lick with my tongue as I lowered to my knees before my incredible wife.On my knees with my back and thighs straight, I could raise my head and stretch my neck to keep kissing and lapping at Janet’s breasts and their turgid tips.  While feasting on my wife’s beauty, water kept getting into my hungry mouth.  It was a near-drowning experience because  I would hold off as long as I could to prolong our enjoyment before pausing to blow the water out of my mouth.  The sensual wet noises made while pleasuring her breasts and expelling the water mixed with our low moans of delight.“You’re going to drown!” My wife laughed.“I don’t care!” I gurgled with feverish desire as I kept enjoying my plight.  I was insatiable, and we were both becoming more excited by the second.  I would have kept going, made love to her in the shower (or anywhere else for that matter) and simply made up an excuse as to why we were late to our family gathering.  That’s what any man would do, I am sure!In hindsight, Janet made the best decision by coming to her senses and abruptly changing our course.  While I was paused, she turned her body so her chest was facing away from me.  “Okay,” she stated, “fun’s over!  We really need to finish our shower and get dressed!”  Now her slick, plush rear end and shapely legs were right before me.“May I have a couple more minutes?” I begged like the incredibly aroused husband that I had become.  My hands were already roaming up her legs.“One minute!” Janet agreed, turning off the water. She extended her arms and pressed her palms against the shower wall in an exciting pose of permission.“Thank you…” I murmured in sincere appreciation, adding gentle kisses on her flesh and massaging her thighs and buttocks. “Just so you know,” I reminded her, “I love playing with your backside just as much as your frontside!”“You’re hopeless!” Janet stated, obviously enjoying my uncontrollable ardor.“Helpless…” I murmured in correction while dreamily continuing to play.  I placed my open hands across the back of her thighs and slid them upward, firmly kneading her muscles, but stopped when I reached the folds of flesh that formed Janet’s butt creases.  With my hands wide open, my fingers rested at the outer edges of those folds and my thumbs lay at their innermost border, almost touching her vulva.  The web of each hand was along the mid portion of each tender crease.Usually, this action would bring a verbal warning from my wife, or she would move away from me.  Surprisingly, Janet kept her body still and gave no verbal protest.  I was surprised because these delicate folds are my wife’s most INSANELY ticklish spots.  Hard tickling in these ultrasensitive creases is too intense for Janet to bear—it’s essentially torture for her, and she will voluntarily or involuntarily react to stop the intolerable, overstimulating sensation.  The poor decision described earlier taught me that. Since then, I have made sure to respectfully avoid these areas as even pretending to threaten a hard tickling might end up with a blown opportunity for lovemaking.  I assumed for years that even attempting to play in this particular erogenous zone was out of the question.Maybe it was having more years of lovemaking experience as a couple or the fact that my wife sometimes engages in and enjoys tickle play  on my body or that my enjoyment of her tickling me was an example to her.  I don’t know.  But today, in the shower, she seemed at ease with my hands wedged in those very sensitive spots, and I decided to see how things would go if I  took a chance.So,  with her butt irresistibly in my hands, I  gave gentle pressure into those sensitive areas, being VERY careful to not squeeze too hard.   I felt the tiniest beginnings of tension building under my hands and paused, holding us both in a blissful fog of anticipation.  I was mesmerized by my present good fortune and the vision of my Janet’s plush, wet rear in front of me.“Oooh my,” I said softly, “you don’t know how badly I  want to “goose” your tush, but I know you don’t like it!”My beautiful wife then responded with a surprising and very erotic answer.  ‘We-ell…” Janet said, drawing out her voice as though searching for the correct words, “maybe it won’t tickle so bad this time…”My mind began spinning with that comment!  In fact, the exact words and tone were seared into my already aroused brain!  Because I become so aroused when she “gooses” my rear, I had always thought teasing her this way could be very arousing to her as well.  However, because of my wife’s previous reactions,  I always kept my urges for this type of foreplay on the back burner.  When your sex life is great, why rock the boat? 🙂But now, with her concession, my long-suppressed desire was instantly reignited!  The part of my brain that is always thinking of ways to explore and enjoy our sexuality lit up in anticipation and curiosity!  My wife’s comment meant that there must be  SOME degree of playful tickling on those sensitive spots that she COULD tolerate and even find pleasurable!  And I was the husband brave enough to explore her beautiful body to find the treasure of sensual delights!“Maybe if I go easy,” I offered, applying just a bit more pressure to her creases.“Yeah… maybe….” Janet began, starting to succumb to the excitement of the moment.  Then she quickly returned to normal thinking, stating, “But we don’t have time for this!  We need to get going!”Our timewasrunning short.  I stood up in obedience to her comment but kept my hands on her waist.   “Mmm, may I try later?” I asked, using my best soft, pleading voice.“Yes,” my wife agreed, but in a very curt fashion.Now I needed (wanted) to make sure her quick answer was not just an automatic response made to escape the present situation.  Morning promises can sometimes be forgotten by the end of the day!  When Janet reached up to retrieve her towel hanging on the shower door frame, I determined that if our brief fun was ending, my wife would have to exit the shower with her ravenous husband clinging to her!  I prevented a quick escape by reaching around and cupping her breasts in my hands.Janet sighed in a small, obligatory show of wifely exasperation, but willingly held very still, allowing me (and us) a few more seconds pleasure!  I hefted those heavy orbs, making sure my palms pressed against her rigid nipples. Then I leaned over her shoulder to whisper in her ear.“Promise?!” I said in a half-question, half-statement, giving those breasts a gentle squeeze.  I desperately wanted a commitment for more fun later when time would be on our side.“Okay—yes!!!” Janet smiled, her answer much more sincere than earlier.  Victorious, I immediately let her go so we could get dressed and ready to leave.We had a nice time at brunch with the kids and doing various chores and activities for the remainder of the day. Near bedtime, we were on the couch reading when I indirectly broached the subject of my wife’s earlier promise.“I think we should head upstairs and get ready for bed,” I mentioned.Janet smiled. “It’s a little early.  Are you tired?” she asked in feigned concern.  Janet is a conservative, country girl and likes to play the innocent virgin just to increase my excitement!  She can be quite the tease!“No,” I responded, “but I thought if we went up now, I could give you a really nice back rub to help you get to sleep.”“Mmmm, that sounds nice!” my wife answered with a grin, knowing I had no plans for sleep.  We went upstairs.Once we turned down the covers, we went to the master closet to change into our sleeping clothes.  However, Janet walked out of the closet wearing only her robe, so I followed her lead, with visions of physical escapades playing in my head!  My wife made sure to hide any full view of her front side as she removed her robe and stretched out, face down on the bed with a pillow under her arms and head.I took a small jar of coconut oil from our nightstand, removed the lid, and placed it on the bed where it would be within easy reach for later use.  I made sure in it was in plain sight, so she could see what delights were coming her way.  Janet loves being slathered with the oil during lovemaking, and tonight I wanted to provide everything to ensure her supreme arousal.After placing my robe aside, I started running my hands over her shoulders and back and spent a long time kneading her soft skin and muscles.  Finally, I murmured, “I love rubbing your back.” I leaned close and gently kissed all over where my hands had been.My wife looked at the jar of coconut oil, and in a tone of surprise, asked, “Are you planning on doing MORE than a massage?” She used her best “innocent girl” voice as if she had never seen her favorite lovemaking accessory or imagined how it would ever fit into tonight’s experience.  Just like a few minutes ago and always, that kind of verbal teasing was very arousing to me!I could play that game as well.  “Well… yes. Yes, I am,” I murmured, “with your permission, of course!”“Mmm, of course.” my wife said, pausing, pretending that she was undecided on our already established plan.  Then she continued. “Are you SURE I’m going to like it?”  “Oh, yes,” I stated confidently, “very, VERY sure.”“That sounds nice,” Janet responded, settling herself more comfortably on the bed in preparation for tonight’s activities.With her permission granted, I  resumed working up and down her body, over her rear, and down her legs all the way to her ankles.  I massaged her feet thoroughly.  “Even your feet have beautiful curves,” I mentioned, my thumbs working into her high arches.  After the sensual foot rub, I reversed direction and made my way back up along the muscles of her calves.“That feels sooo good,” my wife complimented. After a few minutes, she suggested, “Why don’t you turn on some relaxing music?”“Because,” I answered softly, “I want to hear every little sound you make while I make you delirious… with pleasure.”My wife became very quiet and hesitated as she contemplated my comment.  “Mmmm… promise?” Janet asked.“Definitely,” I answered back.Straddling her legs, I returned to massaging and kneading the muscles of her thighs and buttocks.  After the firm pressure,  I traced my fingertips in a light, feathery fashion, caressing all over the flesh of her luscious rear, working luxuriously and slowly.  My wife murmured softly in contentment as I continued, little goosebumps forming all over her lower half.  When I finally paused, my hands were resting just below the sensitive creases that I had so respectfully avoided earlier while in the shower.  We both knew that this was the point at which I had paused earlier in the day.  Now,  would my wife disregard her morning promises or let me indulge my desires?  My pulse quickened with anticipation.“Sooo…” I whispered. “May I play with your very sexy rear?”My wife smiled.  “You mean you want to TICKLE it, don’t you?” she asked, in a voice of inquisition.“Yes,” I confessed, my voice hoarse with excitement from my true desire.“Tell me,” Janet said. ” Why do you have this infatuation with my butt?  It seems so… kinky!”  Her comments were not derogatory or negative,  but had a tone of curiosity—and very possibly, excitement at my proposition.I took a deep breath. “You know how your tickling gets me… aroused,” I started. “Especially when you grab my rear!”“Yeah!” Janet acknowledged.“And when you tease my man parts!” I continued, referring to the times when Janet has used her light, tickly touch on my balls and perineum.She knew exactly what I was talking about.  “Yeah,” she said, “that REALLY drives you crazy!”“I want to do the same thing with you,” I said, “to see if I can getyouexcited that way!”“You’ve played with my backside plenty of times,” Janet answered, referring to when I’ve ocassionally used a light touch all over her rear, even teasing her perineum and wandering onto her vulva for more serious sexual fun. “What do you want to do differently tonight?” she asked with a knowing grin.  She clearly knew what was on the agenda, but was going to make me tell more.“I’m always careful to avoid goosing your rear,” I answered, “because I know you can’t stand it!”“Thank you for THAT!” Janet said, smiling.“Well,” I continued, “in the shower this morning, you made it sound like you could maybe tolerate a little bit of tickling. It may be a little kinky, but it’s something I would love to do with you… if you’re  willing.”“Well, it’s not always the same,” my wife explained.  “Sometimes, when I’m in the right mood, It feels like a little bit might be okay…” She smiled.“Like earlier in the shower?” I asked.“Yeah, because I was already excited!” Janet replied.“What about now?”“Mmm,” she teased, “it would probably be okay…”“That’s what I want to try tonight,” I said.  “Just a little bit. I promise to be careful; I’ll stop whenever you say.” I was very excited about the possibility and tried to cover all the bases so my wife would be agreeable to my intentions.She was silent, obviously contemplating my offer, while I was going crazy with the idea of exploring my wife’s body in this new and different way.“Pleease?” I pleaded, with anguish in my voice.“Oh, my…” Janet smiled. “You poor thing! You’ve been wanting this a long time.”“I have!” I answered.“W-e-e-ell”—my wife deliciously prolonged that first word—”maybe if you tell me EXACTLY what you want, and ask very nicely…” Janet was now obviously enjoying holding my feverish desire hostage with her inviting, naked backside on display before me.  I knew what I needed to do!Knowing my opportunity was closer than ever, I resumed a gentle massage of my wife’s thighs and rump.  Then I began willingly and shamelessly pleading for her wonderful body.“Please,” I murmured. “May I please, please  tickle your sexy bottom?”“Oh, my,” she said, “you’re very good at begging for what you want! Do you promise to be gentle?” Janet asked.“Yes,” I answered.“And then what?” she continued, smiling.“W-e-e-ll,” I said, drawing out that word as she had to get her attention.  “After I tickle your bottom, I’d like to tease you all the way into next week—and then  wreck the bed with your body until we fall asleep!’“Oh, my, ” she said again. “Mmmmm, do you promise?”“Oh, absolutely.”“Then you have my permission!” Janet said.I was aching to begin, but first I had her raise her hips, and I slid a pillow under her pelvis.  The pillow elevated her bottom nicely, so there was room between the bed and her vulva.  This would not only be a good position for sensual tickling, but for all the teasing I had planned for later. I asked her to open her legs.Kneeling on the bed, I scooted forward,  pressing my left knee against the inside of her left thigh.  Since her left limb couldn’t go any farther outward, my knee would help hold her still from any involuntary reactions to my playing, but she wouldn’t feel fully trapped.  With her right leg free,  Janet could move if she needed relief from the sensual intensity I planned to create.  Also, it showed her that I wasn’t going to hold her down if she really wanted a break or if I overstepped our (her) boundaries.With my fingers and thumbs spread wide, I slid my open hands up the back of her thighs and into her most sensitive creases.  I paused, letting her anticipation build, then applied just a little pressure on that soft flesh.  I let Janet become accustomed to that minimal level of stimulation before pressing in a little harder.  Her butt cheeks tensed just a little as she awaited her fate.“Are you ready?” I asked, my voice shaky from excitement.“Uh-huh,” my wife sighed, then held her breath.  I gave those soft spots a gentle, probing squeeze.  “Uuuuh!” She gasped lightly, and her breathing quickened.After a brief pause, I delivered another delicious squeeze, just a little firmer this time.“Aah!” Janet gasped louder, and her rear end twitched a bit.  I waited for her body and mind to calm down. Her cooperation was very arousing to me, so I had to be very careful not to go too far too fast.“May I go again?” I asked.“Uh-huh…” she murmured.I delivered another couple of squeezes into her sensitive folds, the first one with greater firmness, the second with firmness and a tiny bit more probing from my fingertips and thumbs.“AH… Ha… Oh…” were the nice little sounds I heard in response to my newest actions.  My wife’s breathing picked up and became a little irregular.  The small noises she had made were definitely from pleasure!  I felt I had been pretty gentle but didn’t know if I had reached her limit yet.  After allowing her a brief respite, I asked once more if I could continue.“I think so-o-o…” my wife murmured.  Janet was still receptive, but her unsteady voice sounded like she might be unsure of how much longer she could go.  I thought of an incentive to help encourage further cooperation.“How about one more, and then I’ll start your reward!” I offered.  We BOTH knew that “rewards” meant moving on to “the real thing” of more sexual play—and the intense teasing I’d promised earlier!“Mmm-hmmm,” she said with a smile, “I’ll bet!”I couldn’t resist a little more verbal teasing. “Oh, I’m sure you’ll love it!”  I smiled and my hands returned to her hot spots.  After making sure she was prepared,  I dug my fingers in just a little harder this time.Janet squirmed under my touch, gurgling, “Ah! GAH!” in response to my more deliberate “goosing” action.  Her breathrate increased, and I waited for her to come back down from the high of my more intense probing.  I was satisfied with how much tickling she had allowed and didn’t want to push the envelope.“You handled all that really well,” I said.  My compliment signaled that I was ready to move on to more definite sexual foreplay.Janet surprised me when she said, “Wait… do one more!”I hadn’t expected this reaction!  “Are you sure?” I asked.“Uh-huh.” She nodded. “A little harder this time. And maybe… more with your thumbs.”I was shocked by her request for further tickling action!  “Really?” I asked.“Yeah.” Her voice was low and gravelly. “I wanna see if I can take it!” she stated.Who was I to argue with my willing wife?  I smiled to myself; our play session was going great!  I obediently placed my hands back in those creases.  My thumbs were on the inside edges of the soft flesh that melded to become the cleft separating her buns, the inner thighs, and the rearmost V of her delicate vulva.  I squeezed firmly with my fingers in those creases, and my thumbs made a little more of a digging motion into those tender nether regions.My wife yelped in excitement, her rear bucking forward a little.  After settling down, Janet said hoarsely, “Again!”My libido jumped a mile as I delivered another goosing tickle to her sensitive creases, with just a bit more authority.This time, my wife gasped and twisted her hips and torso involuntarily to escape my probing actions, but still gave no verbal or physical cues that she was demanding I stop!I was SO aroused by her reactions, I almost couldn’t stop!  Part of me SO wanted to keep squeezing just a little longer—and harder!  Thankfully, I was able to maintain my self-control and my promise to be nice!  I relinquished my hold on her soft flesh.“Sorry,” I offered, thinking I might have to apologize for going too hard this time.“That’s okay!” she gurgled, cutting me off as she continued.  “Oh, my… that was… I think… Uuuh… It’s kind of… making me excited!”  Janet’s breathing had gotten deeper and faster, but now it was recovering.  Janet was still turned slightly on her right side, with her back and rear pointing slightly away from me.  Her upper body was turned as well, and  I could see the entire side of her full left breast and its VERY erect nipple.“This is DEFINITELY making you excited!” I smiled as I used my hands to gently guide my wife back onto her stomach, with her hips still resting on top of the pillow.I patted the inside of her legs as a silent request, and Janet opened her limbs again.  I slid into position, my knees apart, my left thigh just barely touching against the inside of my wife’s left thigh.  Again, the pressure I gave was not to make her feel trapped but served as a reminder that for tonight, her sweet bottom was all mine for our pleasure.Janet glanced back at me. “Don’t I need to turn over?” she asked teasingly as if giving me a chance to skip right to the “best part”—but there was no way I was giving up her rear end spread out like a feast before me!“Oh, no…” I replied and began running my hands over her thighs and butt once more. “I’m going to keep playing with this sexy rear—I just can’t get enough of it!” I punctuated my comment with a playful pinch on her bottom.My wife murmured in approval, folded her arms around the pillow under her head and rested with her face turned toward me.  I started kneading her upper thighs and the flesh of that luscious butt.  I gradually lessened the pressure from my hands, then slowed the pace of my movements.  Before long, I had transitioned into slow, feathery caresses on her bottom.  I noticed goosebumps of excitement forming on my wife’s skin.  The more I teased, the more little sighs and murmurs came from my wife’s lips.  My right hand began more firmly touching her rear, its fingers and thumb finding the soft folds that form the lowest edge of her butt cheeks.  That little bit of flesh was very soft, and I could ever-so-lightly pinch it and slide my fingers and thumb along the fold, following the sensual trail that led right into the southernmost edge of her vulva.As I teased along my newly chosen path, I heard more distinct noises from my wife.  With one fingertip, I lightly grazed the tiny folds of her vulva.  Her little sounds were almost inaudible, but then I brushed the small patch of skin of her perineum.  That caused a more distinct little gasp of pleasure, and her growing excitement was given away by her back rising and falling from deeper breathing.I kept using a couple of fingertips from my right to keep light, tickly caresses going on the tender folds of her labia while my left-hand fingertips skimmed all over her rear end and finally, into the sensitive flesh of the cleft of her butt crack. I wasn’t going to touch her puckered little hole, but I teased that most private, sensitive flesh of her backside while my other fingertips feathered her perineum and the folds where her vulva, outer and inner lips all met together.Both hands working on her bottom made my wife very squirmy as she continued with sweet little noises of delight.  It was fun to experience my spouse trying her best to hold still under my relentless teasing.  I couldn’t resist asking for a bit of confirmation.“So,” I said softly, “you like my sexy tickling?”“Uhhhh… Uh-huh…” Janet sighed.  Her own thinking was gone, replaced by the wonderful sensations of my hands and fingers.“See, I was right,” I whispered.  “Your sounds are so much  better than any music I could have chosen.”My wife moaned deliciously in response as I kept my fingertips moving, gently exploring her most private parts.  My beautiful, willing wife was slowly becoming more and more aroused when I decided to introduce something I knew would send her even further into her state of bliss.“You know what comes next,” I said matter of factly.I’m sure my comment startled Janet’s psyche.  After the privilege of tickling her bottom and now teasing her in a sexual way, what more was left to do to her poor, overstimulated body?I didn’t make her answer, but instead, simply reminded her, “Your favorite—coconut oil!”Our journey had already been so passionate that my wife had forgotten about the enjoyable accessory still waiting nearby. Her only response to my reminder was a gurgled sigh of “UUuuuh…” as she acknowledged more loving and teasing yet to come.Keeping my knees in position and her legs apart, I reached over for the jar of magical lubricant and placed it within easy reach.  My wife was silent as I took a couple of good dollops and began slathering it all over the fleshy mounds of her rump.  She did try to open her thighs a little further, and I acknowledged her effort with a “Thank you!”I worked the oil into every tender fold of flesh, the backs of her thighs, and everywhere else I could reach, but avoided any of her private parts for now.  I made sure there was an excess of oil and watched as the aphrodisiac warmed up and some slowly trickled down the mounds of her rear into her folds and places I’d not touched.  Finally, some made its way to the rearmost edges of her privates.Janet’s pelvis was elevated slightly, and her vulva was essentially hanging free from the edges of the pillow, so I could reach under and explore quite a ways forward.  That was going to be the next delicious destination of our journey.  I used one fingertip to follow the oil to the rearmost beginnings of her nether parts.“Oh, my,” I said with fake surprise. “Some oil is dripping down there. Should I take care of it?” I concentrated my finger on her slippery perineum, touching the very sensitive spot gently.“Ah!” Janet gasped. “Yes, please!” My wife was warming up quite nicely to my relentless play.“I’ll be glad to,” I said. I let my fingertip caress that one little span of flesh a bit, then used all my fingers to roam all over the folds of her vulva, caressing forward to explore among the sparse hair and make sure to spread oil all over her outer private part.The next stop on Janet’s journey of pleasure was her warm inner labia.  Instead of using my fingertips, I chose to try something more… interesting.  I turned my palm down toward the bed and curled my fingers loosely.  Then I rubbed the backs of my fingers on my wife’s rump, making sure some coconut oil coated all the middle knuckles of my digits.  Now with my fingers bent, those oiled knuckles could glide nicely from back to front over my wife’s vulva.  The middle finger knuckle was particularly curious and stayed between the warm, moist folds of her inner lips.Janet’s breathing became irregular as her body reacted to this different sensation, and light moans came from her half-open mouth.  I slid that knuckle back and forth, occasionally bumping into the area near her clit.“Oh, my…” my beautiful wife sighed.  I backed my knuckle out of the ‘hot zone’ immediately.  I turned my hand back over, so I had good contact with her vulva against my palm, and my fingers were able to press and play on her outer parts.  Then I used my left-hand fingertips and thumb to begin exploring all over Janet’s neglected rump.My wife suddenly said, “Oh… I think I want to turn over!”I wasn’t holding her down, but I wasn’t ready to stop pleasuring her bottom.  “Wait, please, ” I asked. “How about you try to hold on until you just can’t take any more, and then turn over?”“Oooh… Kaaaay…” Janet groaned in response.I just continued gently teasing her rear end and her front side, and she became silent in her willing cooperation.  Soon, my fingertips were again exploring her inner labia.  One fingertip slipped upward between those folds, and I felt her own fluid—lots of fluid!“Oh, my,” I said, “you’re SOOO wet.”  I knew my comment would increase Janet’s arousal; she loves it when I describe her body’s helpless response to my teasing.  I used my finger to caress just inside the already wet entrance of her private vault, coaxing more fluid from her body.  “Oh, wow…” I murmured in delight. “The sheet is going to be soaked…”She performed just as I expected: a longer moan escaped her lips, and her hips squirmed just a bit.   I pressed my finger up into her folds a little farther and massaged her wet inner walls.  My wife was clutching at the sheets with both hands, holding on so nicely and trying to keep her excited body at my mercy.  I knew exactly how she felt, as she’s had me in the same situation many times!  She was delirious, loving the relentless, unending pleasure of my foreplay, and simply did not want it to end!But my erection was throbbing, and the longer I played with my wife, the less time I would be able to spend using my male organ to pleasure her.  I teased closer to the swollen area around her clit while I gave her left butt crease the perfect gentle tickling squeeze.Janet gasped loudly.  “GAH!” she blurted out, twisting her body. “I’ve GOT to turn over!”I paused my hands immediately and let her roll over onto her back.  I enjoyed the view of her torso as she changed positions because her large breasts look great bouncing around while she turns over.  In seconds, she was on her back, her rump still on the pillow.  There was a pillow under her head as well, but I gave her a couple of others so she could prop up her upper half while her hips were still on the thinner one.  This would be a great position for the last phase of tonight’s lovemaking session.I stayed between her legs, but I could reach up with more oil and massage it into the flesh of her beautiful, full breasts.  I let my thumbs toy with her nipples, but after all of my teasing, Janet was quickly becoming VERY excited.  Her breasts and nipples are extremely sensitive, and she let me know it!My wife groaned, “Ooooh, honey! I don’t think I can take much of this!’I responded perfectly to her comments, releasing her chest and using a hand to steer the head of my throbbing erection into her warm, inviting slit.  Then I slid forward until I was all the way inside.“AH! Yeah!” I grunted with satisfaction as I felt her wet tightness all around me.  She made her own noises of delight as well, but I didn’t give her any respite. I had promised a pounding, and a pounding she would get—a nice, slow but passionate pounding.  Relishing all the time she’d given me to indulge my desires, I soon found our usual rhythm, moving steadily in and out.  I made sure to punctuate each deep thrust with a heartfelt, “Thank you!” to show my sincere husbandly appreciation for all of her willing cooperation.Janet just groaned, “Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!” in response to every thrust.I now fully appreciated my creative idea to position my wife properly as she turned onto her back. Her upper body was angled up on multiple pillows with her hips slightly lower, nestled into a single pillow. This was such a perfect situation because her body was held still by the friction of the bedding against the sheets as I picked up the force and pace of my thrusting and started really going at her!  Now my powerful thrusts achieved full depth without her body shifting away on the bed.  But with my pelvic motions, I was still able to cause her breasts to shake and shift beautifully on her chest!Janet reached up to tease my own pecs and nipples.  Her exquisite touch was soon sending me into a real frenzy, and I responded the only way possible.  I moved my hips a little faster but significantly harder, a wonderfully satisfying combination for a now wildly excited old married couple.  Now we were really banging together, my arousal enhanced by the vision of her large breasts bobbling with each thrust and the look of intensity on Janet’s face.Amongst all the noise we were making, I did one more thing that I knew my wife would love.  As a powerful orgasm headed toward us, I reached over to Janet’s left nipple and teased and tugged it just a little.“Go for me, baby!” was my last encouragement that sent my beautiful wife moaning loudly and bucking over the edge.  I followed right behind her, waves of pleasure causing my own variety of movements and helpless, loud noises.After we expended our energy, I collapsed beside Janet on the bed.  As we recovered from our incredible experience, I finally spoke.“Oh my,” I said, “tonight was so… incredible!  Thank you!  It was all SOOO exciting!”My wife rolled over and up on her elbow next to me.  “Yes, it was,” Janet agreed. “The bed is soaking wet, and the pillows are a wreck!  You were a wild man tonight!”Of course, I beamed in husbandly satisfaction at those comments.  A large wet spot showed evidence of our activities, as well as the pillow that had been under her hips. That one had taken all the punishment while I pounded my wife’s beautiful body, and it was left a mashed-up, wrinkled mess—just more evidence that tonight had been extra special.“I had to keep my promises!” I teased.  “And I was a wild man, but you make me that way!”“Mmm,” my wife answered back, “because I let you be kinky and play with my butt!”“Yeah, well…”  I grinned.  “What can I say?  You set me on fire!  Something has to be done to put out the flames!”“Yeeeeaah, ” Janet smiled.  “But you were a kinky wild man tonight—and that’s all on YOU!”“It’s not kinky to be so excited for my wife!” I stated.“I’m talking about this “thing” you have for tickling.”  She smiled again.  “Admit it! That’s kinky!”“Okay, I’ll admit it,” I said.  “But I can’t help it!  Somehow, the way you touch me—that light touch… It’s magic!  It’s like a tickling sensation on steroids!  It just gets me so excited!”She was just contemplating my words, so I went on.  “And by the way, I am infatuated with many areas of your body! Your legs, your chest, that spot on your groin… They’re all God’s gifts to me, so it’s only natural to enjoy them!  As far as your rear end, I’ve always known it was super ticklish, but I’ve also wondered what would happen if I was… careful about it. I thought that maybe I could make it exciting for you, as well.  Thank you for letting me play with your body that way!  It was fun, especially AFTER the tickling!”“I did enjoy it,”  my wife acknowledged, “because you were careful and didn’t go too hard or too long!  I was kind of worried you might go overboard, like sometimes in the past!  But you were very nice, and it did turn out… fun!”“Mmmm,” I smiled. “Fun enough to do it again?”“If I’m in the right mood,” Janet said. “A good massage, a little bit ofnicetickling, a lot of lovemaking… I could probably go for that, at least once in a while—if you can promise to be nice and not overdo it.”“I”ll always be nice…” I said.  “I would never want to ruin a good thing now that I know you’re okay with it! I just know how your ‘sexy tickling’ turns me on, and I wanted to return the favor.  Now I know it’s one more little spicy thing to keep in mind for whenever you’re ‘in the right mood.'”Janet said, “Yeah, I think we can keep it on the menu.”
