Ann and I have always gone through phases—times where we’re all about full-on sex, and other times when we’re more into toying and masturbating together. Usually, it’s during the colder months—when it’s easier to stay bundled up under covers than to get naked and take another shower. And honestly, I’ve never had a single complaint when she looks over at me and says, “Wanna toy with me?” Because when she says that, I know it’s about to get hot.It usually starts with her stroking me until I’m rock hard, then turning her vibe on herself while I take over, slicking my hand with coconut oil. And sometimes, while I’m stroking, I catch her sneaking glances at my cock—shiny and veiny, the head darkening to that deep purple she loves.Meanwhile, she’s under the covers, working the vibrator against her clit. I can’t see what’s happening under there, so I’m left to imagine—and man, my imagination runs wild. I picture her on all fours in front of me, her lips vibrating and dripping wet. I picture her straddling my face, her scent hitting me before anything else. Sometimes I even think about those rare moments when I’ve walked in on her playing alone and she just lets me stand there and watch.And sometimes, my mind wanders even further—replaying old adventures, or creating new ones right there in the dark. Every now and then, I start describing these fantasies out loud, as quietly as I can—because with five, six, sometimes seven kids in the house, we don’t exactly have privacy. But instead of rushing us toward the finish line, those whispered stories tend to slow everything down, make us savor the moment—turning what starts as a quick release into a drawn-out, heated session where neither of us wants to be the first to give in.Not long ago, one afternoon, I woke up from a nap still half-hard, and Ann was still sleeping beside me. I laid there, thinking about how much she loves when I share those stories aloud—and how women online are always talking about loving “spicy” books. I wondered… what if she had her own story? One that was about her—forher?So, lying right there in bed, I started typing, recalling a recent experience that had us both on fire. I planned to save it for when she traveled—something she could read and think about me. But only two days later, the perfect chance to share it showed up sooner than I thought.That morning, she woke me up to let the cat out of the room—casually promising me she’d “pay me back” that night with a blowjob. She even brought it up later in the day, saying, “I think I dreamed I promised you something this morning,” and “You can’t push my head, but you can pull my hair.”Later that day, as I took one of the kids to practice, I couldn’t stop thinking about it—and decided it was time to send her that story. Sitting in the parking lot of a car wash, I took screenshots of the story sent them—no explanation, no context, just… sent.The second I saw she read it, my heart started pounding. Did she like it? Was she into it?A minute later, her reply lit up my screen:“My heart is beating hard in my chest. Hhmmm.”And just like that, I was hard in a community center lobby, praying nobody needed me to stand up right then.Back home, I could feel the tension between us. We went about the usual bedtime chaos with the kids, but every time I caught her looking at me, her eyes would drift down to my gray sweatshorts, where the evidence of my arousal was more than obvious.Finally, when the house was quiet, we found a moment alone on the couch. She leaned in, her voice low, almost a whisper:“I can’t believe you wrote… porn… about me… to me. Is that the first time you’ve done that?”I nodded, and grinned. “Yeah. First time. But you seemed to like it.”She gave me a smirk that could melt steel.“Oh yes. Very much so.”As her show ended and I was cleaning up in the kitchen, she stood up, telling me to leave the kitchen mess for later. No, wait. She actually stopped me at the sink, reached into my shorts, and pulled out my cock, slipping it between her lips without a word. After a slow, teasing taste, she looked up at me, eyes sparkling.“We’ve got things to do upstairs.”Upstairs, I barely had time to clear off the loveseat and toss a pillow down for her knees before I dropping my shorts and presenting her a chance to make good on her promise.She did more than that.  One of the best blowjobs of my life—easily top five. Probably the best sober one she’s ever given me. She lubed me up with coconut oil, stroking as she bobbed on the tip, her bathrobe falling open just enough to allow me to see her boobs bounce with every movement.I was in heaven. Watching her mouth, her hands, her body—it was almost too much. I had to warn her.“I just want you to know… I’m not going to have any cock left for your pussy unless you’re interested in a round two.”She pulled back, smiled up at me, and said, “Okay, then. Where and how do you want to cum?”I could barely think straight. “Anywhere. On your tits, your ass, in you—I don’t care. I’ll love every second.”Then she surprised me.“So you’d be okay if I just sat on your cock and grinded myself to an orgasm?”“Yes. Please.”Her robe hit the floor, and before I knew it, she was turned around lowering herself onto me, wet and ready. I suggested, “I mean… if you wanted to give me a taste first…” but she was already taking me all the way in.She rode me slowly at first, making sure I was good and coated in her slickness, then brought the vibrator back to her clit. Watching her sexy ass grind, feeling her tighten up as she chased her orgasm—I dared not blink.And she was close—closer than I realized. Her pussy clenched hard as she came, her body trembling. But she wasn’t done.Tossing the vibe aside, she placed her hands on my knees, lifted herself just slightly, and began slamming back down on my cock. I couldn’t hold back anymore.A few strokes later, I was spilling everything inside her, groaning as I held her hips, not wanting to let her go.As we cleaned up, one thought ran on repeat in my mind:“I need to write this one out—and figure out the perfect time to share it.”
