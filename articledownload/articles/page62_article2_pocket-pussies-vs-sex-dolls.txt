Not sure if this has been discussed here before, but I’m curious to hear everyone’s thoughts. Not sure what side I may even fall on, so I’m really just throwing the question out there.I think it’s safe to say most people on MH are okay with male toys like the Fleshlight, pocket pussies, etc., but do full size sex dolls fall into that category too? And if not, where exactly is the line where it becomes too much? There’s a wide range of toys between the smallest pocket pussy and a full size doll. And if a doll could be a moral grey area, where does that start?I would love to here everyone’s thoughts on this.
