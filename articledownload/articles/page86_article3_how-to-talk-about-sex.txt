The comments to this post include the occasional use of strong language (L).Hello, everyone. Missy here.About a year ago, MH conducted a survey asking what, if any, problems our readers perceived with their married sex life. It will probably come as no surprise that the overwhelming majority of responses pointed to mismatched libido. Most men, and some women, felt that they would like to have sex more often, with a smaller but still significant percentage saying they’d like more variety or for their spouse to be open to exploration within the boundaries of marriage.We thought it might be nice if those of you who have seen improvement in adding frequency or novelty to your sex lives would share with your fellow MHers how you kickstarted the conversations that led to change. Or did you have to talk at all? What did you do or change that helped your partner more fully embrace the freedom God gives us in pleasing each other sexually? Or what did you try that didn’t work and you’d suggest others avoid?And… GO!
