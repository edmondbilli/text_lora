One of LLL’s comments recently caused me to go on a bit of an encouragement soapbox in my reply. I’m not picking on her in any way. I have all the respect in the world for her. But I think that many women share in the difficulty of seeing themselves as beautiful and feminine.Secular society is largely to blame for this. By creating “beauty standards” which are so ingrained, they are very difficult to overcome or see past.I find that repulsive because Psalms 139:14 says“I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made”.In addition, Solomon didn’t give a bra size in Proverbs 5:19“Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.”Nor did he or the wife reference bra size, dress size, or specific features discussing sexuality in Song of Solomon.Some men with their attitudes and expectations don’t help either. I also find this repulsive and would invite those men to take a look in the mirror.So, my mini-rant is complete (for now). Keeping Solomon’s attitude in mind, I invite MH gentlemen to list why you think your wife is the sexiest fucking thing you’ve ever seen.I also invite the self-assured ladies to comment on the beautiful wonder that is gloriously female.– KM
