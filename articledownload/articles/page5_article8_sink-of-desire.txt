(L) – This story contains strong language.A Note from MarriageHeat:This story contains something known as “breath play,” where one partner’s breathing is restricted to various levels in order to enhance sexual excitement. This can be a potentially dangerous thing if not handled carefully. However, this couple (as they explain in the “Author’s Note about Safety Concerns” below) has considered and prepared to minimize the risks. Please exercise moderation and caution if you decide to engage in this kind of play.Author’s Note:Thank you for taking the time to read our latest story today! As always, it’s based on events from our lives, which are shared for enjoyment. We understand that not everyone shares the same interests or desires, and we mean no offence if the content of this story isn’t to your liking. We are in a consensual D/s (Dominance and submission) relationship and are exploring our sexuality together as a couple, grounded in love, mutual respect and scripture. We appreciate your understanding and wish you a happy reading!Author’s Note about Safety Concerns:The risks of this kind of play are something we take very seriously. Every scene we explore is grounded in mutual consent, deep trust, and careful preparation. In fact, before we ever explored breath play, Master Joe and I both attended an in-depth first aid course through our church, which helped us feel more confident about understanding the risks and responding safely if something were to go wrong. Even now, we talk extensively before and after each scene to make sure we’re aligned emotionally, physically, and spiritually.**********Gabriel stood​ at the kitchen door, his hair damp from the shower, droplets still clinging​ to his chest beneath the loosely tied bathrobe. His breath caught​ as​ he saw Andrea standing​ at the sink, her back​ to him, framed​ by the glowing cityscape​ of Paris beyond the window.She was radiant, bathed​ in the golden glow​ of the skyline. Her toned figure was accentuated​ by the olive-green Sweaty Betty activewear, which clung​ to her body like​ a second skin.The crisscross straps traced elegant lines over her bronzed shoulders, drawing his gaze down​ to the subtle curve​ of her waist and hips. She shifted slightly, her hips swaying​ in rhythm​ to the soft music playing​ in the background, her voice low and sensual​ as she sang along. The pink marigold gloves​ on her hands should have been out​ of place, but even that seemed effortlessly seductive​ on her.She leaned forward, gazing dreamily out over the Parisian lights, utterly unaware​ of his presence. Gabriel’s pulse quickened, his desire for her growing with each second​ he watched. The sight​ of her,​ sо carefree yet intoxicatingly alluring, was enough​ to draw him forward.Andrea jumped with​ a start​ as Gabriel pressed​ up behind her, his damp chest brushing her back. She turned her head sharply,​ a hint​ of annoyance flashing​ in her eyes. “Gabriel, I’m busy,” Andrea protested, glancing​ at her soapy, pink-marigold-gloved hands. She had the gym soon, and the dishes weren’t done.But then, the soft tension​ of the gown tie slipped over her wrists, his skilled hands tying​ a timber hitch with deliberate care. Her heart raced, her frustration melting into​ a thrilling mix​ of excitement and intrigue.“You’re impossible,” she muttered, her voice softening,​ a smile tugging​ at the corners​ of her lips.Gabriel leaned closer, his damp chest pressed firmly against Andrea’s back. Reaching over her,​ he deftly tied her pink-gloved hands​ to the window handle, his breath warm against her neck.With​ a gentle tug,​ he tested his knot work. Andrea pulled gently against her bindings, but they were snug. The timber hitch held fast. She was trapped.His breath caught​ as​ he ran his hands​ up her hips, the curves​ of her body accentuated​ by the sleek fabric. Andrea let out​ a soft sigh​ of pleasure, relaxing into his touch​ as​ he teased his fingertips along her thighs and down her stomach.Gabriel nuzzled against her neck, pressing his lips​ to her skin​ as his hand slid over her hip. Andrea bit her lip, her body pressing back against him with anticipation​ as Gabriel slowly slid his fingertips​ up her side and traced along the underside​ of her breast.Her breath caught​ as his thumb brushed over her nipple, rolling​ іt gently beneath the soft fabric​ of her top. Gabriel trailed slow kisses across her shoulder, savouring each moment, every curve, every inch​ of her.Andrea pressed back against him, revelling​ in the feel​ of his warm, bare skin against hers, his muscular body behind her. His desire for her was evident, and she was growing impatient, yearning for more.She ground her hips back against him, delighting​ in the sharp intake​ of breath from Gabriel. She could feel his heart racing, matching the quickening pace​ of her own.A shiver ran down Andrea’s spine​ as Gabriel’s lips trailed slowly​ up her neck, his warm breath sending tingles through her body. When​ he gently sucked​ on her ear,​ a soft gasp escaped her lips, her annoyance dissolving entirely into​ a rush​ of pleasure. Her knees weakened, her head tilting instinctively​ to give him better access, the sensation igniting​ a thrilling heat that made her pulse race. She bit her lip, unable​ to hide how much she loved his touch, her body melting into his.Cupping her breast, Gabriel rolled her erect nipples through the fabric​ of her top. Andrea pulled back against her bindings, but the timber hitch held firm.Gabriel’s other hand traced​ up along the base​ of her neck, teasing her sensitive skin before grasping her neck and squeezing his prey tightly. Andrea gasped​ as​ he drew her in, his mouth covering hers​ in​ a kiss that took her breath away.The pressure​ of his grip​ on her neck made the kiss even more erotic, intensifying the fire building​ in her core. She pressed back against him, grinding her hips against his erection, eager​ to feel him inside her.But Gabriel seemed​ to​ be​ in​ no rush.​ He broke the kiss, trailing kisses along her jaw and neck​ as his fingers squeezed harder, cutting off her breath. Andrea began​ to turn red and tried​ to pull away, but the window handle held her firmly​ in place. The sudden panic mixed with the thrill​ of being​ sо helpless, entirely​ at his mercy, only stoked the fire burning inside her. Her heart raced​ as she struggled​ to breathe, the lack​ of oxygen heightening her senses and intensifying each sensation.When Gabriel released her neck,​ he whispered, “Breathe.”Andrea drew​ in​ a deep, gasping breath, filling her lungs. Gabriel leaned back slightly, running his hands down her arms, savouring the feel​ of her trembling beneath his fingertips.His touch sent electric sparks through her, his skilled hands teasing her skin until she was writhing with anticipation again. She could feel his heart racing​ as​ he cupped her breasts again, and she bit her lip​ as his fingers slipped beneath the edge​ of her top and tugged​ іt​ up over her breasts.She shivered​ as cool air kissed her exposed flesh, the sensation replaced​ by the warmth​ of Gabriel’s lips pressing against her back, tracing soft kisses down her spine. She looked through the window, dreading voyeuristic eyes staring back​ at them.Gabriel’s hands were​ a contrast​ of forces, one gripping her neck firmly, squeezing hard, commanding control ​of every breath​ he would allow her, while the other moved with gentle, tender strokes across her bum, creating​ a thrilling balance​ of strength and softness. Andrea rolled her eyes back​ as she fought for air, pulling against the ties she knew would not release her from this pleasurable torture.When Gabriel released her neck, she leaned forward over the sink, gasping for breath. Her whole body ached with need. The ache​ in her core grew more assertive​ as he pressed his hand​ on her back, pushing her down over the warm, soapy water​ in the sink.“Gabriel,” Andrea whined.He didn’t say anything. He only gave her​ a knowing smile​ as​ he pulled her leggings down​ to expose her naked bum. The sight​ of her bare, toned arse only fuelled his lust for her even further.Andrea let out​ a soft sigh​ as Gabriel’s fingers slid around her leg and between her legs. His digits rolled between the soft, wet lips​ of her labia​ as​ he began searching for her clit. Finding her hard pea, Gabriel gently eased two fingers over it, flicking and rolling quickly. She leaned back into him, moaning softly​ as​ he massaged her with slow, sensual movements.The sound​ of her moans was music​ to Gabriel’s ears, and​ he increased his pace before sliding his fingers down her slit and pressing his fingers into her heat. Gabriel moved his fingers​ in and out​ of her with increasing urgency. She ground her hips into his hand, gasping​ as​ he began rubbing her clit with his thumb​ at the same time.Andrea pulled​ on the tie, which held her firm. She wanted Gabriel inside her​ sо badly.​ It felt like​ an eternity since she’d had​ an orgasm.​ It felt like ages. Gabriel increased his pace and pressure, thrusting deeper, curling his fingers​ up​ to caress her G-spot.Her climax was building quickly. She cried out​ in pleasure​ as his fingertips teased her G-spot, and her juices coated his fingers​ as she was about​ to orgasm—when​ he suddenly stopped teasing her.“Does​ my wash maid want​ to orgasm?”​ he said, leaning over her and whispering into her back.Andrea moaned​ as she nodded, her body trembling with need. She was​ sо close​ to orgasm, and her mind clouded with desire.“Do you want​ to orgasm,​ my dirty little maid?”“Yes! Please!” she cried out, desperate for him​ to continue.Gabriel pulled his fingers out​ of her and brought them​ up​ to her mouth. She greedily sucked​ on his fingers, licking away all the juices​ as​ he watched her. She wanted more,​ sо much more.He pulled his fingers out​ of her mouth, then grabbed her​ by the hair and pushed her down against the sink. The hot water splashed​ up over her top, making the fabric cling​ to her erect nipples. She cried out​ in pain​ as ​he pushed her head into the water. The soapy water covered her face.“How bad does​ my maid want​ to orgasm?”​ he asked, holding her face under the water, but leaving her ears free to hear.Andrea struggled against the ties that held her​ in place, but the timber hitch refused​ to give way. She pulled her head​ up out​ of the water and gasped for air. She could feel his erection pressing against her ass. She tried​ to push back against him, but​ he held her tight, his grip​ on her hair still firm.​ He yanked her​ up hard, making her gasp​ in pain​ and cry out.“How bad​ do you want​ to orgasm? Answer me.”She looked down​ at the water swirling before her, unable​ to speak.“Tell​ me how bad you want​ to orgasm,”​ he demanded.“I…I…”She couldn’t respond. The fear and pain intertwined with the pleasure and exhilaration, igniting​ a thrill that excited her far more than​ it frightened her. Deep down, she knew she was safe, that this was part​ of their consensual agreement,​ a boundary they both trusted and embraced.He forced her head back into the soapy water​ of the sink. Her nose and mouth filled with warm liquid​ as she flailed and struggled for air.Andrea pulled against the ties binding her wrists, desperate for air. She could feel him behind her, pressing his hard cock​ up against her wet ass.​ He thrust forward, pushing into her pussy. She gasped​ in pain​ as​ he slid into her.​ He was huge, stretching her tight hole wide​ as​ he buried himself deep inside her.​ He grunted​ as​ he pumped​ in and out, fucking her roughly.She felt the water bubbling​ into her nostrils, forcing​ іts way into her throat. The pain was unbearable. She held her breath and then felt the sweet release​ of fresh air​ on her face. She spluttered and coughed​ as Gabriel fucked her harder from behind.“One more,​ my dirty little maid?”​ he asked​ as his body rhythmically moved back and forth into her.She looked out the window. The elderly couple​ in the opposite building were sitting​ on their verandah enjoying their morning coffee, oblivious​ of events happening meters away from their happy Sunday morning. She turned back​ to see Gabriel looking down​ at her. She knew​ he was waiting for​ a response. She looked down​ at the sink and nodded.Gabriel smiled, bent her over the sink, and held her under the water again.​ He fucked her furiously, slamming into her with long, deep strokes. Her tits bounced against the edge​ of the sink​ as she took his cock. She thrashed​ in the water, her cries muffled. Gabriel felt her vagina tighten around his cock​ as​ he pulled her out​ of the water.“You’re such​ a naughty little maid, aren’t you? Dirty girl. Tell​ me how much you love being fucked like this.”She coughed​ up water, gasping for air.“I…love…being…fucked…like…this,” she sputtered.He fucked her faster, harder, making her tits bounce violently. Her wet hair flew​ in every direction.“Yes, you love it. You love being​ a dirty little whore for me, don’t you?”“Yes! Yes!​ I love it!” she cried out between coughs.“Fuck yes! Take​ my fucking cock, you dirty slut!”She couldn’t speak, only moan​ as​ he fucked her even harder. His hips slammed into her ass. She could feel his cock throbbing inside her. She wanted​ to cum​ so badly. She wanted​ to feel him explode inside her.“Come on, come on, dirty maid, cum​ on​ my cock.”Andrea orgasmed first.​ It was violent and loud.​ An exploration​ of pure pleasure that radiated throughout her entire body. She screamed​ as​ he kept thrusting into her, fucking her through her climax.​ He came​ as her orgasm continued, filling her with hot liquid. They rode the waves​ of pleasure together before​ he collapsed​ on top​ of her over the sink. Gabriel leaned forward and kissed Andrea gently​ on the cheek.Gabriel untied her wrists and released her from the window handle, wrapping his arms around her waist.​ He kissed her neck​ as she caught her breath.Andrea looked out​ of the window, seeing their neighbours utterly unaware​ of the scene that had just occurred.Andrea turned​ to face him, pressing her wet breasts against his chest.“Well, Sir,​ I can’t​ go​ to the gym like this,” she said, gesturing down​ at her sopping wet top, “Maybe Sir would take​ me upstairs and give​ me​ a spanking for not finishing the dishes.”Gabriel raised​ an eyebrow.“Well then, you know what you must do, right?”Andrea gave him​ a wink, then turned and rushed upstairs, laughing all the way.​ He smiled​ to himself​ as​ he followed.
