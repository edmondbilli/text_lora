I hadn’t used myvibratorin a while. As you all may know by now, I generally just grind on a towel. So a few nights ago, I got it out.  I was aroused and antsy due to a sexy WWII novel, and the movie into which it was made. And I was also nearing ovulation. Yes, I was horny and hot.As usual, I started with towel grinding.  I was face-down on the floor, pretending that I was astride my future husband, slowly and deliciously riding his dick.  My extreme wetness prompted me to grab the vibe and give it a try.  I wanted to feel something in me and picture it as my husband penetrating me.It took several attempts, because I was really tight and couldn’t get it in at all. After reheating myself with more grinding, my body loosened and I pushed the vibe in.  I whispered hot things to my imaginary husband. I fantasized we were in WWII and he was a Marine colonel on leave.  He was claiming me, making me his wife in every respect.  I additionally listened to some hot audio to get myself worked up even more.Maybe it was because I hadn’t used the vibe in many weeks and everything was so tight. But it felt SO good.  I could really feel the sensation as I twisted it deeply inside my cunt.  That was new; typically I can’t feel much internally.  Everything felt so hot and slick and my hand was all sticky as my juices leaked out over the vibe.  My hips were wriggling as I imagined my guy plowing into me, screwing for all he was worth.That and the audio of a guy yelling in orgasm made me go over.  I trembled more and for longer than I ever had and my loins clenched.  That was definitely one of the best climaxes I ever experienced.  It took a minute or two to calm down and release the tension. I had some trouble pulling thevibeout because I was tight again, maybe still convulsing from the orgasm.  But the vibe popped out in a slippery mess and I just laid there getting my breath.  Whew! A very enjoyable session.
