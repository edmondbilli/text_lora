This is my first post.I’m 62, and my wife will be 60 soon. I’ve been married 39 years, and sex has always been predictable: same time, same position, etc. And all of a sudden a few years ago, sex kind of dried up. I have health issues with my back and recently had hip replacement. I take pain meds for degenerative disc disease, and I have problems with getting and or maintaining an erection.My wife is very beautiful and sexy, so I wonder, why is it that I’m very horny but can’t get an erection or maintain one? I wake up every day with a large hard-on, so I know my penis still works, but not when I want it to. I’d love to do oral, but my wife has always been against it. I’m aroused to the point I’d almost jump on any willing woman, but you know I can’t. I would love a way to clarify that I’m still capable. I’m lost and very confused. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
