Something that puzzles me about couples having any kind of morning lovemaking is how to deal with bad morning breath.  It seems in every movie or story, when a couple starts getting amorous after waking up, they don’t even notice each other’s bad breath.What do you couples do about it? Is it just something you endure? Or are you so aroused you don’t even notice it? I know my own morning breath is absolutely lethal, so I need some tips for dealing with that.  And I’m already a very oral-hygiene-conscious person!
