It has been several years since I contributed. But well, I’m now a septuagenarian, old, decrepit, falling apart, and my 5 year/50,000 mile warranty has long expired.  This is a true experience, albeit decades ago, in San Diego.You may recall from my first story how Mary and I eloped on 2/28/77. Then I headed back up to the PNW until she finished her education degree at the Bible college in Springfield.  I picked her up when she graduated, and with the U-Haul hitched to the Dodge Dart. Off we went to San Diego, where my ship was now home-ported.We made it to the local independent Baptist church for evening services, and got rid of the trailer and hitch.  The church was kind to let me set up temporary housing in their empty missionary house, located on the church campus, until I could find an apartment. This was no easy task being at sea during the week, and only having part of the weekend off.Well.  I had been riding my 12-speed bicycle to work each morning, and back to that house each evening.  It was much easier than dealing with the commute’s traffic jams and parking issues at 32nd St. Naval Station.  I had the timing down to the minute. Getting to the ship, reporting aboard, going to my rack, putting on my uniform, and making it to “quarters” at 0745. With time to spare.It was a Monday morning, and we were going to spend the week at sea. I daren’t miss movement, as that was a punishable offense, and would end my Naval career.  BUT!  Mary was exceedingly horny.  And she was begging me to not leave–not yet!“Please!  Pleasefuckme!!!”I was shocked–SHOCKED!!to hear such a word coming out of the mouth of my dear, sweet Baptist wife.  😀And so I did.  I dropped my running shorts and briefs, fucked her, made her cum, came myself. Wasting no time, I pulled the briefs and shorts on, grabbed my bike, and flew down the streets, to the pier. Crossing the brow, I got the bike stowed, changed, and made it to quarters with seconds to spare. I assisted my fellow Electrician’s Mates pull the eight shore power cables up from the pier. Then I commenced my regular ship’s work.  And all day, I was a sticky mess!Memories…..
