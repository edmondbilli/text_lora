I enjoy reading interesting MH discussion topics, so I would like to suggest one of my own:For male readers: (1) On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your individual satisfaction/pleasure level after a bedroom sex experience? And (2) what could your wife do to/for you to boost the intensity of your orgasm? And, finally, (3) would you feel comfortable discussing the answer to  number two with her?For female readers: (1) on a scale of 1-10, what is your current level of pleasure after a bedroom sex experience? What would you love to have him do more, or less? (2) If you were to give him one honest tip on how to give you a more intense orgasm, what would it be? And (3) Would you feel comfortable discussing tha answer to number two with him?Final question for both sexes: How often do you masturbate (1) alone? (2) with your spouse participating with you? (3) While your spouse is only observing?Let’s be honest everyone and maybe your comments will validate lovemaking habits for some and inspire new ideas for others.THANKS!
