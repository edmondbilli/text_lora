This post was partly a comment I made on November 17, 2023, regarding an excellent story called “Max Is Back” by ClimaXX.  Music has frequently helped set the mood and/or made my Melody and I downright warm for each other’s form.  Some songs on our playlist are more my favorites and some are more Melody’s favorites.  But a LOT of the songs we both like!So I added more songs etc. to this post than on my original comment. Of course a lot of these songs really date us, but y’all know that we are senior lovers and proud of it!  We highly recommend music to set the mood.  We originally used music in part to help dampen our lovemaking sounds.  I had kids from a previous marriage and our condominium had kinda thin walls.  As a married adult our oldest daughter told us that it didn’t work to muffle Melody’s and my enthusiastic sex sounds.I am curious. If, like us, you and your spouse often listen to “mood” music during sex. If so, what are some of the song titles?For us SOME sexy songs directly inspire passion (AKA make us horny).
