Lacy always has been in tremendous shape.  She is very beautiful, tall and fit, with large breasts and an ass just made for yoga pants.  She has been working as an online fitness trainer, with classes for cardio workouts and yoga.  Both men and women attend these classes.  She has attracted attention from both sexes that borders on being out of line at times for a married woman.  When it happens, she has been open and honest with me about it, and has booted a couple men out of the classes.She has become close with a beautiful girl who is a fitness model and influencer.  The girl, Jamie, has been trying hard to get Lacy to do it as well.  She says she makes a crazy amount of money.  The sponsor company sends workout clothing to wear and model. The models take pictures both casually wearing the clothes, and using them as intended.  If you sign up to model swimwear, the money gets stupid.Lacy has shown me Jamie’s photos, and the clothing leaves little to the imagination. The “look” goes beyond flattering to arousing, as the clothes mold perfectly to her body.My own business has taken a hit since Covid, and it’s been a struggle. I’ve taken a part-time consulting job to make ends meet. This leaves no time for Lacy and leads to needless, selfish fights, taking a toll on both of us.Lacy asked if she could be a model, until things get better.  The money would be amazing, but I’m not sure I want to share her that way.  To have people acknowledge Lacy’s beauty is one thing. For them to have thoughts of her that only I should have is another. I don’t know how I would process it all.Please give me your honest thoughts, from both men’s and women’s perspective.  Thank you.
