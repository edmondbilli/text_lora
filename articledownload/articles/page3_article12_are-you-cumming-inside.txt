(L) – This story contains strong language.Andrea’s heels clicked softly​ on the worn, tiled floor​ of The Little Red Door, one​ of Paris’s most enigmatic cocktail bars. The dim lighting, flickering candles, and exposed brick walls gave the space​ an intimate, almost secretive air. The faint hum​ of jazz music underscored the quiet murmur​ of conversations, creating​ an atmosphere charged with possibility. Her black strappy heels caught the warm, golden light, the sharp lines​ of the straps highlighting her elegant movements​ as she made her way​ to the bar.She spotted him immediately. Gabriel was leaning against the counter,​ a glass​ of amber liquid resting​ in his hand.​ He looked almost out​ of place among the artsy crowd, his crisp white shirt open​ at the collar and​ a tailored black jacket emphasising his broad frame. Yet, the way his dark curls fell loosely across his forehead and the relaxed confidence​ in his posture seemed​ to draw attention effortlessly. Andrea’s lips curled into​ a faint smile​ as their eyes met across the room.Sliding onto the stool beside him, she didn’t wait for​ an invitation. “Buy​ me​ a drink,” she said, her tone playful yet commanding. Her gaze flicked​ to the bartender, then back​ to Gabriel, daring him​ to refuse. She crossed her legs deliberately, and her heels brushed his leg, drawing his eyes down exactly where she wanted them.He raised​ an eyebrow, amused but intrigued.​ “I wouldn’t dream​ of saying no,”​ he replied smoothly, signalling the bartender with​ an easy motion.The bartender placed​ a delicately crafted cocktail​ in front​ of her, the glass rimmed with citrus and herbs. Andrea’s fingers brushed Gabriel’s​ as she reached for it, their contact brief but charged. She took​ a slow sip, her eyes never leaving his. They talked​ in low voices, their conversation​ a dance​ of veiled truths and playful lies, leaning into the game they were pretending​ to play.“Are you just passing through?” she asked casually, her fingers tracing the rim​ of her glass. Her tone carried​ a hint​ of mystery, though they both knew​ it wasn’t the truth.“Yes,” Gabriel replied, his voice steady, but his eyes betrayed him.“Lucky for me, then,” Andrea said with​ a soft smile, her gaze lingering​ on his​ as she caught the flicker​ of his attention drifting downward. His eyes traced the curve​ of her lips before trailing lower, drawn​ to the subtle shift​ of her dress​ as​ it revealed more​ of her bare legs. The soft glow​ of the bar light accentuated the smooth lines​ of her skin. Gabriel swallowed hard, his composure slipping for just​ a moment. Gabriel noticed​ a spark​ of satisfaction flickering​ in her smile​ as she adjusted her posture, enticing him further without​ a word.Andrea caught his glance and, ever​ so subtly, parted her legs just enough​ to let the hem​ of her dress slip higher. The effect was immediate, his breath quickened, and the tension between them thickened.“It’s getting late,” Andrea said, leaning closer, her voice soft but laced with invitation.​ “I don’t live far. Why don’t you come back with me?”Gabriel didn’t hesitate.​ He downed the rest​ of his drink and stood, following her out into the quiet Parisian night. Outside, the air was fresh, and the streetlights cast golden reflections across the cobblestones. Andrea’s heels clicked rhythmically​ as they walked​ to her car, his eyes trailing her every move.Gabriel leaned against the car, watching​ as Andrea walked around​ to the driver’s side, her heels clicking against the pavement​ in rhythm with his heartbeat. She moved with​ an effortless grace, her dress swaying just enough​ to offer fleeting glimpses​ of her bare legs.​ His breath hitched as she reached the door and lifted one leg​ to slide into the seat. The hem​ of her dress rode​ up ever​ so slightly, revealing just enough​ to make him wonder, was she wearing lingerie beneath it,​ or was his imagination playing tricks? The question hung tantalisingly​ in his mind​ as she settled into the seat, her movements deliberate yet casual,​ as though she knew exactly what she was doing​ to him.Sliding into the driver’s seat, Andrea started the engine, and the soft glow​ of the dashboard bathed the interior. Gabriel’s eyes traced the way the light played across her legs, golden and smooth, the delicate straps​ of her heels only heightening the allure. She shifted slightly, her legs parting just enough​ to expose more skin. His breathing deepened, and for​ a moment,​ he was sure she was smirking, though her eyes remained fixed​ on the road ahead.The car hummed softly, and the dashboard’s warm glow cast flickering shadows across her skin. Gabriel sat silently beside her, their tension crackling​ in the confined space. The faint scent​ of her perfume and the cool night breeze drifting through the cracked window intoxicated him even further.His gaze lingered, unable​ to resist the hypnotic pull​ of her legs​ as they caught the shifting light from the street lamps. Her skin seemed​ to glow with every flash,​ a mesmerising dance​ of amber and shadow. When she moved again, the dress rode higher​ as she manoeuvred the gearshift, and his pulse quickened. Her legs parted slightly, and this time, there was​ no mistaking the invitation.Gabriel’s fingers hovered for​ a moment, hesitating before they landed delicately​ on her knee. The touch was featherlight but electric, sending​ a shiver through her. Andrea’s breath hitched, but she kept her eyes​ on the road, her lips curling into​ a knowing smile. Slowly, her legs parted further, her body wordlessly urging him​ to continue.Emboldened, Gabriel’s fingertips began to trace along her thigh, the motion slow and deliberate, savouring every inch. Her skin was impossibly soft and warm beneath his touch, and with every centimetre he covered, his breathing grew heavier, his heart pounding in his chest. Andrea’s grip on the steering wheel tightened, her anticipation building as his hand slid higher, nearing the point where tension and desire threatened to snap.Her lips parted​ in​ a quiet sigh, but just​ as Gabriel’s fingers approached the top​ of her thighs, Andrea’s legs snapped shut, trapping his hand between them. The sudden motion startled him, and​ he exhaled​ a shaky breath.“We’re here,” she said, her voice calm yet tinged with amusement. She turned slightly, meeting his gaze for the first time since they’d entered the car. Her eyes gleamed with mischief, her lips curving into​ a teasing smile.Andrea stepped out​ of the car with effortless grace, her heels clicking softly against the pavement​ as she walked​ to the door​ of her house. The soft swish​ of her dress was the only sound​ in the quiet night, and Gabriel couldn’t take his eyes off her.At the door, she glanced over her shoulder, that same playful smile tugging​ at her lips. “Well,” she shouted​ to him as he still sat in the car​, “Are you cumming inside?”Gabriel rushed​ to the front door. As​ he arrived, his eyes looked for her​ in the low light. They eventually found her, and watched as she leaned over the sofa, turned her head, and looked directly​ at him.“Are you cumming inside?” she asked again, her face flushed. Gabriel noticed she had her hands between her legs, rubbing her clit​ as she looked​ at him. Reaching back, she lifted her dress, exposing her naked arse, the fingers still rubbing her clit.Gabriel closed the distance between them, his eyes fixated​ on the glistening wetness between her legs.“Cum inside,” she demanded, letting her fingers drop from her clit and spread her labia apart for him.Gabriel did​ as​ he was told, unfastening his trousers and letting them drop​ to the floor. His fingers ran through the wet folds​ of her pussy before grasping his cock and guiding​ it​ to her expectant heat.Andrea moaned loudly as his helmet slipped into her cunt, his body weight​ settling on her back​ as​ he entered her from behind.Gabriel started softly, but Andrea wanted​ it her way.“Harder,” she panted​ as his cock began​ to pound her. Her hips met his thrusts​ as she let her fingers flick her clit.“Baise moi plus fort!” she cried. Gabriel obliged, fucking harder, his fingers digging into her hips​ as​ he pounded her from behind.“Fuck, I’m gonna cum!” Andrea screamed, her pussy beginning​ to spasm. She leaned back​ to hold his head, her breasts popping out​ of the dress, bouncing with every press​ he gave her.“Cum inside,” she hissed, feeling her pussy contract. Gabriel didn’t need any more encouragement​ as his seed flooded her. As she felt his heat spread inside her, she orgasmed violently. Her pelvic muscles tightened around him, and she shook uncontrollably, screaming.“Oui, oui, oui!”Gabriel slumped over her and slowly drew his cock out​ of her pulsing pussy.​ As​ he did, a trickle​ of cum seeped out and ran down her thigh.“Merci,” she said​ in​ a low voice, pushing him off her and turning around.She leaned forward and kissed his soft lips, his breath still laboured and panting. When she pulled back, she smiled. Not the inviting, playful one she’d worn all night, but something sharper, more deliberate. Her eyes gleamed with mischief​ as she whispered, her voice low and cutting through the charged silence, “Now… fuck off.”Gabriel froze the words hanging​ in the air between them.​ He blinked, his mind racing​ to process what he’d just heard. “Wait… what?”​ he asked, his voice quiet, incredulous.Andrea stepped back, crossing her arms loosely across her exposed tits, her smile widening with satisfaction.“You heard me,” she said, calm but unyielding. “Fuck off.”His jaw tightened​ as​ he realised this wasn’t anger​ or rejection. This was her game, her fantasy, playing out exactly how she wanted.​ He shook his head,​ a surprised laugh escaping his lips​ as​ he tried​ to mask the sting​ of her words. “You’re serious,”​ he said, though​ it wasn’t​ a question.Andrea didn’t answer. She just gestured toward the open door. Her gaze was steady, unrelenting. Gabriel held her stare​ a moment longer​ as​ if daring her​ to break character, but she didn’t waver. Finally,​ he exhaled and stepped away, running​ a hand through his hair.He made his way to the door, feeling the cold French night greet him with a sharp chill. The quiet streets were starkly different from the warmth he’d just left behind. He turned back one last time, as if waiting for her to say something, to call him back, but she remained by the door, watching him with that same amused expression.“Goodnight, Gabriel,” she said, her voice soft but final.With​ a slight, rueful shake​ of his head,​ he stepped outside. The door closed firmly behind him, followed​ by the unmistakable sound​ of the lock turning. Gabriel stood​ on the doorstep for​ a moment, his breath visible​ in the crisp night air.​ He glanced​ up​ at the starry sky, then down the empty road,​ a chuckle escaping his lips despite himself.Inside, Andrea leaned back against the door, her chest rising and falling​ as she let out​ a long, shuddering breath.​ A flush​ of exhilaration ran through her, the thrill​ of the moment still buzzing​ in her veins. She smiled, closing her eyes briefly​ as she replayed the scene​ in her mind.​ It had been perfect, every detail exactly​ as she’d imagined it. She felt like she’d truly been​ in charge​ of her fantasy for the first time​ in​ a long time.Outside, Gabriel adjusted his jacket against the biting cold, glancing down the quiet street. “Well,”​ he muttered, shoving his hands into his pockets. “Guess I’m finding​ a hotel.”​ He took​ a step forward, his thoughts still​ on Andrea. The night left him equally frustrated, intrigued, and amused.
