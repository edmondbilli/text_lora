Sigh.I’m writing this as a wife who feels I’ve been robbed of intimacy with my husband. I love this man, but we are 12, nearly 13 years apart in age. I am in my late twenties, he is turning 40 in a few days. We MAYBE have sex 1-2 times a week. Some weeks, not at all.My husband has had every blood test done and his testosterone is within the normal range. He says he enjoys sex but doesn’t think about it like most men do. I am beautiful (not to toot my own horn). I have beautiful auburn hair, a nice perky butt, and small, but super perky boobies. My husband tells me I’m beautiful, but I want him to lust after me the way I do him.I have taken all the initiative and I want him to just grab me and passionately do me. I dream of being taken by him in an aggressive, but intimate way. I just needed to vent I guess. We have been married for 2 years and it has been this way since the beginning. I’m feeling really lonely and he has not been super understanding, but very defensive when I bring this up.Thanks for listening, and in advance for any thoughts you may have.
