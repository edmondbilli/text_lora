Hello to everyone here at Marriage Heat. I’ve known about Marriage Heat for several months, and I created an account here last month. I’m a 36-year-old, single, African-American man. My siblings and I were raised in a strong Christian household by two great Christian parents. Sometime in the future, I might share my backstory with everyone here and the struggles I’ve had as a young Christian to be sexually pure. But in this article, I’ll get right to my point.I’ve been seeking to both enjoy and create Christian erotica as an alternative to worldly pornography. Throughout the year, I’ve read articles from different Christians that argue that erotica and masturbation are not necessarily sinful. Some of those articles are here on this site. I know the primary purpose of Marriage Heat is to provide a safe space for Christian couples to write about their sexual relationships with their spouses. But does this site allow erotic stories written by Christian singles? I’m waiting till I get married to have sex, as God commands in his Word. But while I wait, I’m interested in writing erotica. I have a bachelor’s degree in writing. But having no sexual experiences outside masturbation, which I’m starting to believe isn’t necessarily wrong, what kind of erotica could a single Christian write?
