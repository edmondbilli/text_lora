This isn’t going to be super sexy or anything, so sorry to disappoint.I’m 19 years old. I just discovered this site and was inspired to actually write myself when I saw a recent story by virgin_pussy.I am also a virgin, and I have been raised in a Christian household. I gave my life to Christ and seek to glorify Him in all things (1st Corinthians 10:31). I have not had any sort of sexual interaction in my life, but am a sexual person by nature. I have had a past with porn but have put that behind me by the grace of God.I seek love. I want to love somebody; I want to be married, have kids, and of course make love. (I don’t want that to sound wrong.) I just struggle with these things and the thoughts I have. I want to bless my future wife, love her, treat her right, etc.I’m not sure how I will use this account. Maybe I’ll write fantasies or whatever. I want to ask a couple questions though.For the married people, what is it like? What do you love about your spouse? What is your favorite sexual thing to do with your spouse? The sexiest part of your spouses body? What do you want to get out of this site? Are there many fellow virgins here?In general, what advice would people give me? Thanks for reading. I look forward to the future!
