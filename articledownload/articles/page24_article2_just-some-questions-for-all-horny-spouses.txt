(F) – This post contains discussions of extra-marital fantasies.(L) – This post contains strong language.MH readers,Let’s begin a Hot Topic shall we? Those of you on this site may know me from very personal stories I have shared, with my hubby Jim being my passionate lover and one who tolerates and encourages my exhibitionist ways. From day one, Jim knew I was a notorious cock teaser and perhaps the horniest woman by nature he has ever met.This being the case, and after 22 blissful years of marriage, I realize I am “oversexed” if you will, but I also know there are many women out there who are more like me than they would care to admit… hubbies, too.So, with this in mind, I have two questions:For us gals, how often are you thinking/fantasizing about getting fucked hard and fast, no foreplay, just an impulsive, well, fucking? Or, just see a bulge in a guys jeans and get creamy thinking about cocksucking? (choose from a. frequently b. sometimes c. never).Guys: Same basic question, but with a kicker: How often are you motivated to pull out your cocks and stroke when the opportunity presents itself in seclusion after sizing up a sweet and sexy woman who you determine to be (as Jim refers to me as) highly fuckable? (choose from a. frequently b. sometimes c. never).And for all, have any of your fantasies (we all have them) included watching your spouse with another partner?Thanks all, still waiting for Jim to return from another long biz trip. Love to all!
