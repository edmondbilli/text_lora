If you are in the U.S., you are probably aware that tomorrow afternoon, millions of people—most of them men—will be parked in front of their screens watching the Philidelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs face off on the gridiron.Some of you may remember atradition that MH started a few years ago, challenging the ladies to a Panties Kickoff at the start of the American football season. Calvin and I would like to reinstitute that sexy ritual for Super Bowl this year. How stimulating and encouraging our men would find it to know that as we snuggle next to them on the sofa or tailgate with our neighbors, we are secretly (or not so secretly) “naked under our clothes.” And wouldn’t that make it so much easier to sneak a little tryst during a commercial break or at half-time? But if you can’t bear to miss the show, you can always get a little handsy under a sofa blanket…Gentlemen, if you’d like to join us, feel free to go commando, too! And one or both of you be sure towrite in about what goes down—before, during, and after the big game. No matter the outcome on the field, we are sure your sex life will be the winner!Love in Christ,Missy
