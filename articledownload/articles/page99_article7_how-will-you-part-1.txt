I watch the clock, counting down the minutes until I’ll hear the sound of crunching gravel. Your arrival is synonymous with my ravishment. I perch on the arm of the couch, letting the rubbing of the material soothe my centre’s aching for you. As I gaze out the window to the lowering sun, my hand lowers too and begins to stoke my flame. How will you claim me tonight?Will your belt hit the mudroom floor seconds after your boots? I crawl to you and pull your pants and briefs to your ankles. From my knees, I engulf your member in my mouth to wordlessly welcome you home. As your prick rises, you sag against the door with a moan. My ministrations work you to a frenzy; your hand knots into my hair, pushing it back while pulling my face into your fervent thrusts.I clutch at your hips, pulling your firm ass forward so I can suck more, more, more. With my mouth still latched to your crotch, you pull my hips so I stand bowed in front of you. As your pelvis pumps into my mouth, your hand traces my spine and pushes beneath the crease of my jeans. I moan around your member as I’m penetrated from both ends, your hand working one, then two digits into my hot cunt. You bounce me between the two parts of yourself, and I flush at the fullness. Your rigid cock pounds into my throat, but I need it elsewhere.You read my mind and withdraw, leaving me empty for an eternity of seconds to snatch my pants down and bend me over the washing machine. Freeing one leg from the denim and raising my knee to the edge, you pump three fingers into me for good measure. I moan, humping the corner of the machine to get relief.“B! I can’t wait!” Your fingers pummel my core. “Please, I can’t hold off!” Your arm pushes my back forward, and my nipples harden as they’re crushed against the cold metal. “B! I nee- FUCK!” You plunge balls-deep in one thrust, and I fall to pieces.Will you claim me like that tonight?
