His desire for me is endless.His passion and fantasies are of me alone.He places me inevery naughty story we read,every picture we see,every video we watch.His lustful imaginingsfor my erotic pleasure are wild,right at the Edge, close to unlimited,and they make me blush.My mind reels, my body aches,to experience and share it with him.When I’ve done so, I will have given us a bondthat few couples share.But, God, I want his heat,his lust, his passion for me!My desire is to fulfill every need of his,to be the fantasy he craves.Lord, thank you for the indescribable blessingof love and passion bound up in this man.In my eyes, he has no equal among men.His cock thrills me, and my desire is to satisfy him alone.My love for him knows no end.He is the love and light of my life.I will love himForever. Always. Only.His desire for me is endless.His passion and fantasies are of me alone.——Queen and Hubbie here:Hubbie: I wrote a long-ago draft of this to declare my besotted love and desire for Queen. I hoped she’d like to hear it, and I love shouting it from the rooftops!Queen: The more I read this, and considered Hubbie’s passion-insanity for me, the more I wanted to unleash my similar passion for him, and add my own words. So I stole it from Hub, added my voice, and herein make it my own!Both: As we enjoy our Empty Nest days together, we are determined to craft our passion and heat for each other with all the fervor and dedication you see above. We hope our intensity, focus, and heat displayed herein encourage you and your spouse to pursue a monogamous, passionate marriage that glorifies God and inspires others to want what you have.
