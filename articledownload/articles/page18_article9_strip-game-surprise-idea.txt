Here’s a quick little idea that might be fun for the wives to initiate.Wait for, or create, an occasion when you are wearing a dress.  When the moment is right, excuse yourself and remove any clothing you have under the dress.  Acting as though nothing has happened, challenge your husband to a stripping game.  When you lose a round (you can choose for yourself if you do this on purpose or not), take off the dress and give him the fun surprise of you being naked underneath!For those of you wives who are a bit more adventurous, you could continue to play the game after you are naked, offering your husband favours or forfeits (use your imagination!) in lieu of items of clothing if you lose another round.  If you are a particularly brave wife, wait until your husband is wearing a large number of items of clothing!Have fun!  And please let us know how it goes!  Please share any favour/forfeit ideas you’ve offered, or would find fun to offer, in a stripping game!
