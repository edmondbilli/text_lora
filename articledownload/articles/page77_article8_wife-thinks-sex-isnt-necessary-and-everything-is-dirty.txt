First of all I am not a writer, but I am looking for some help.At times, the wife of 35 years enjoys mutual masturbation, but she doesn’t feel inclined to do it on her own. Says she doesn’t need it and never has sexual thoughts. She doesn’t feel foreplay is necessary but often claims everything hurts.In our younger years, she enjoyed anal, but now won’t even consider it, doesn’t enjoy receiving oral, and doesn’t do anything to try and get aroused. She has never had multiple orgasms and shows no interest in trying. She reaches orgasm within 15 minutes at all times, and then she’s ready to quit.I, on the other hand, need much more sex and am willing to do whatever for however long she needs. I  have purchased every sex toy known to man, and she typically likes them the first time, but never uses them again. What can I  do?
