Ladies of MH, I am puzzled about something. In the course of really learning about the mechanics of sexual pleasure, I have gathered that most women cannot orgasm from penis-in-vagina sex alone. Yet in so many of these stories, the wives are absolutely convulsing with the rapture they’re feeling from being pounded by their men.What is the source of this pleasure? Are their G- or A-spots being stimulated? Are their clits always being touched, even if it wasn’t mentioned? I’m super curious. I can’t feel anything when I work a finger in and out of my vagina. I know the clitoris is much bigger and more complex internally, so is it those invisible parts I need to be stimulating? Thanks for your kind help!
