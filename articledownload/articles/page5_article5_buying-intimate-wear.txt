M. and I were having a discussion about things we’ve adopted in our life, and we’re wondering what others do, especially as relates to intimate wear.We went through years of purchasing something for each other only to find out it didn’t fit, or it wasn’t desirable for the person it was being bought for. Often things would be sent back.Now when it comes to underwear or intimate wear, we keep in mind that it should be meant not only for yourself, but for the other person in your life with whom you’re intimate.We came to an agreement where we do our shopping online when we want to buy something that’s intimate. This includes my bras, underwear (for both him and me), stockings, bodysuits, and what we have come to lovingly call “slutwear”—that’s clothing for me that means “I want sex now, and I mean business!”We learned a lot about each other doing this together. I also learned a lot about myself by considering what I had been buying and my reasons for buying it. Usually I bought things for comfort and practicality, while he bought things for sex. Buying lingerie together and being able to talk it out as were purchasing it has definitely been a bonus in our sex life.On more than one occasion, just looking at, discussing it and making the purchase would result in a level of arousal that would end up with the two of us having sex. And when it arrived, there was lots of anticipation and planning involved. It would usually include a date night, with the knowledge that when it came to actually undressing one another, there would be a present underneath!That present might be a pair of sexy underwear for him, which would let me see the pouch being filled with his bulge, and would get me thinking how I would go about making it as hard as possible. Or maybe the present would allow him to see my breasts perfectly cradled, or let his hands running over smooth, sexy stockings, or let him spread my legs and use the accessibility of crotchless panties.I think you get the idea.So what about everybody else? Do you do this, or do you just buy things on your own when planning a special night for the two of you? Whether you are the husband or wife in the couple, what are the criteria for what you like seeing your partner in?🔥❤️L&M❤️🔥
