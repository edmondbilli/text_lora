I am a single 30-something man who would very much like to be married and have sex some day, and who sometimes finds himself frustrated with waiting.  I would appreciate some advice regarding how best to channel my desires in the meantime.  Any general advice would be welcome, but I’ve thought of some more specific questions:What would be some good things to pray for (aside from finding a wife obviously!)?What would be good things to think about in terms of what I might want my sex life to look like when I do get married?  Or perhaps the sort of conversations I should have if I find a (potential) partner?What might be more practical, but ‘Godly’, ways to channel my desires?Is there anything you know about sex now that you wish you knew when you were single?One thing I have found helpful is praying for the marriages of my friends, including their sex lives.  So one more question:What would be good things to pray for on behalf of my friends?Thanks for your advice!
