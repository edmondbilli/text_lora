A recent post by NorthernSky got me to thinking. He mentioned his wife’s booty getting glances here and there. He didn’t mention her doing anything on purpose, but I’ve often wondered how many ladies do subtle little things or dress in a subtle little way to show off a little bit.Some examples of this might be a figure-hugging skirt, a short little dress, or a blouse that shows off the girls.I’ve noticed that even “conservative” women will wear a plunging neckline, a loose neckline that falls open when they bend over, or a blouse with full coverage except for a little opening exposing some cleavage. Sometimes they even wear these things to church. Sometimes they will even wear something a little see-through, or a light bra that showcases a little jiggle when they walk.So, for the ladies—married or single—how much of this is on purpose? And, even if you wouldn’t normally admit it, how much do you enjoy the glances that you get?For the guys, (married, with a girlfriend, or thoughts for a future significant other), do you or would you enjoy your wife or gal showing off a little bit?As always, fill in the blanks with your own experiences, comments, or choices.[Disclaimer: Of course, I don’t mean that anyone wants to be cat-called, leered at, or otherwise subjected to crude or inappropriate behavior. This is never okay.]
