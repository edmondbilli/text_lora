After several of you suggested that I video myself masturbating so I can someday give the videos to my future husband, I’ve fallen in love with the idea more and more.However, I want to keep it very private and store such files so no one will accidentally see them.  I use Google and Gmail for a lot of things, and my photos usually go to Google Drive.  I don’t know if people can see them or not; I know that photos from months or even years ago will still pop up on Google Drive.So, can anyone recommend the best app for taking private pics and videos and keeping it separate from your Google account? I’d probably end up ripping the files off my phone and keeping them on a thumb drive anyhow.  Thanks for any advice!
