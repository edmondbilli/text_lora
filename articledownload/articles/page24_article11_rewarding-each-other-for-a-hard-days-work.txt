(L) – This story contains strong language.The August heat wave was in full force with no signs of relenting.For some that meant staying inside with air conditioning and a cool drink.But when you make a living from the land, those comforts must wait until the work is done.Our day was spent building a new stretch of barbed wire fence, digging post holes and setting posts for corners and H braces, driving steel posts into the sun-baked ground, and stringing out rolls of wire.At least we were able to spend the day together, working side by side.With the last strand of barbed wire tight and fastened to the steel posts, and the sun setting below the west horizon, it was finally time to call it a day.We started to load the remaining wire, tools and equipment in the bed of pickup.Working with barbed wire, we wear denim long-sleeved shirts, and in this heat, they were soaked.I looked at my wife and said, “I bet you’re ready to strip that heavy shirt and cool off.”She said, “I thought you would never ask!”The pearl snaps on that shirt snapped open and before I knew it, her bra was off and she headed for the big stock tank in the corner of the pasture.She looked over her shoulder and said, “Are you going to join me or not?”She wiggled out of her wranglers, kicked off her boots, and dove into the tank of cold, clear water.The windmill that feeds the tank pulls cool water up from 100 feet underground, and the shade of the big cottonwood tree keeps the sun from heating up the water.It didn’t take me long to decide that I could load the pickup later.I piled my sweaty clothes and work boots next to hers and joined my wife for a cool splash in the tank.I have never been so tired and so turned on at the same time.The cool water reinvigorated our tired bodies.I sat back against side of the tank and my wife laid back against me, rubbing my tired forearms while I filled my hands with her beautiful breasts, pinching and massaging her nipples as the sunset glow began fading away.We stayed there like that, enjoying the evening breeze until the stars started to light up the night sky.Then my wife pivoted on my lap enough to kiss me and guided one of my hands down to her waist.I took it the rest of the way and slid my calloused finger tips over and all around her soft clit. Encouraged by her increasingly deep kisses,Ifollowed the slit below, parted her lips and pushed two fingers just inside of her.I don’t know if it was the buoyancy of the water or pure adrenaline that assisted me, but with that one hand, I lifted and turned my beautiful wife 180 degrees so she was now straddling me.For a few minutes, I continued to finger her with one hand in her pussy, one hand full of tits, and a mouthful of her lips and tongue while she floated just above me in the water.Slowly, I slid my fingers out and retraced the path back up to her breasts.She brought her legs up and wrapped them around my back, and in one smooth motion, she engulfed my dick with her pussy.The motion and positions possible in the buoyancy of that cold water was like nothing we had ever experienced in a bed, and we fucked like we had never fucked before in wave after wave of pure ecstasy.Totally satisfied and completely exhausted now, we held each other and gazed at the stars until a little after midnight. WE finally air-dried, climbed back into the pickup, and headed back home for a well-earned but short night’s sleep.
