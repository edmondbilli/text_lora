[This is a topic that MarriageHeat revisits periodically. Here we present an opinion piece from one of our contributors and welcome your commentary, knowing it will vary widely but be offered in a spirit of kindness.]Many people wonder what’s the difference between erotica and pornography. If you understand the Greek root words, it is not difficult. Erotica comes from the Greek word eros pertaining to sexual matters. Pornography comes from the Greek word porneia pertaining to sexual immorality. It is connected to the word fornication. All pornography is erotica, but not all erotica is pornography. According to that definition, Song of Solomon is clearly erotica but not pornographic.One counselor posted on her website about the difference between mindless pornography and mindful arousal. One of my favorite illustrations describes it as the difference between a Corvette and a Porsche. Both cars have a lot of muscle, but the Porsche has a feel like a fine musical instrument that enhances the experience of listening to many of the great classics—much more fulfilling than raw power alone. It’s the difference between listening to Led Zeppelin in a  Corvette at 120 mph versus listening to Bach in a Porsche at 120 mph (legal on the German Autobahn). [Incidentally, I didn’t get a Porsche but got to drive its Audi sibling 150 mph on the Autobahn.]
