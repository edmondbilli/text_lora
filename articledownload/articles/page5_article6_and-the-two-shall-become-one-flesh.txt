(L) – This story contains strong language.The storm came down hard, hammering against the tin roof of the small rented house. Wind howled through the cracks in the walls. It was the kind of weather that turned roads into rivers and stranded travelers for the night.Daniel Mercer sat at the wooden table, his Bible open before him, though he hadn’t turned a page in minutes. His wife, Sarah, sat beside him, wrapped in a thick blanket, her golden hair still damp from the rain. Across from them, Luke Carter, his closest friend and fellow miner, leaned back in his chair, tapping his fingers restlessly against his mug of coffee.The three of them had been friends for years, their bond forged in the fires of faith. Daniel and Sarah had been high school sweethearts, married young, both deep believers in the Word of God. Luke had been at their wedding, had even been the one to pray over them before their wedding night, asking for their union to be blessed.But now, in the dim glow of the oil lamp, there was a tension that hadn’t been there before.“Looks like you’re staying the night,” Luke finally said, glancing toward the window. The rain showed no signs of stopping. “Ain’t no way you’re makin’ it back home in this mess.”Sarah shifted beside Daniel, pulling the blanket tighter. “I should’ve left earlier,” she murmured.Daniel shook his head, placing his hand over hers. “No, God’s will is in all things,” he reassured her. His voice was calm, but something in his touch lingered—warm, firm. She glanced up at him, their eyes locking for a second too long.Luke chuckled. “Guess this is what they mean when they say The Lord works in mysterious ways.”Daniel smirked but said nothing.The sleeping arrangement was obvious—the bunk bed. The house was small, just two rooms. One for eating and sitting, one for sleeping. The bunk bed had always been enough for Daniel and Luke. But tonight, with Sarah here, the balance was different.“I can take the floor,” Luke offered, though there was something in his tone—a hesitation.“Nonsense,” Daniel said, shaking his head. “You take the top bunk like always. Sarah and I will have the bottom.”Luke nodded slowly, standing. “Alright then. I’ll be turnin’ in.” He disappeared into the small washroom, the door creaking shut behind him.Sarah shifted beside Daniel, her hand still under his. Her voice was quiet, teasing. “A man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife… and the two shall become one flesh…”Daniel swallowed hard.Matthew 19:5. He knew the verse.And he knew what she meant.The rain outside showed no signs of stopping. The tiny house trembled under the storm, but inside, the tension between Daniel and Sarah burned hotter than the oil lamp flickering on the nightstand.Luke had already climbed into the top bunk, his back turned, one arm dangling over the side. His breaths were slow, steady—but Daniel knew his friend was still awake.The bunk bed creaked as Daniel and Sarah settled beneath the blankets of the lower mattress. It was tight, forcing them to press close.Too close.Sarah sighed softly, curling into him. The scent of her—rain, lavender, something purely feminine—made Daniel’s throat go dry.“It’s been too long,” she whispered.He closed his eyes, knowing exactly what she meant.“Sarah,” he warned, but her fingers were already tracing slow, deliberate circles on his chest.“Marriage must be honored by all,” she murmured, her lips barely brushing his ear. Hebrews 13:4.Daniel exhaled sharply, his grip on the blanket tightening. “Not here,” he hissed under his breath.Sarah giggled—a dangerous, knowing sound.“We’re married, aren’t we?” she teased, pressing her thigh between his. “The Lord sees everything anyway. What’s one more set of eyes?”Above them, the bunk creaked slightly.Daniel glanced toward the ceiling, knowing Luke was right there.Awake. Listening.His best friend. A man he’d prayed beside. A man he’d trusted with his life in the mines.And yet, with Sarah’s hands slipping lower, her breath hot against his skin, Daniel couldn’t stop himself.She was his wife. And a man must not deny his wife her due.His hand slipped beneath her dress, grazing the soft, warm skin of her thigh.Sarah shuddered, pressing her face against his neck to stifle her moan.The bed creaked again—louder this time.Daniel swallowed hard.Above them, Luke let out a slow, shaky exhale. He was definitely awake. And from the sound of it… He wasn’t just listening.The bunk bed creaked again, more pronounced this time, but Daniel barely noticed.His wife was in his arms—and she was burning for him.Sarah’s fingers slid lower, gripping his cock through his pants, her touch both familiar and forbidden in this moment. Daniel sucked in a sharp breath, eyes flicking up toward the wooden slats above them.Luke was still. Too still.The rhythmic shifting from the top bunk had ceased, but the air in the room had changed. Daniel could feel it—the weight of another man’s presence in the dark, knowing that Luke was listening—watching, maybe.A shiver ran through him, half shame, half thrill.Sarah’s voice was barely a whisper against his skin. “Take me, husband.”Daniel clenched his jaw.“Sarah—”Her nails dug into his chest, and her lips brushed his ear. “You know the Word,” she murmured, voice thick with need. “Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time… then come together again.”Daniel groaned softly. 1 Corinthians 7:5.He couldn’t resist her. He never could.His hands were on her, gripping her hips, sliding up her thighs, pushing her dress higher, exposing more and more of her perfect, soft skin. Sarah gasped, burying her face against his neck, muffling the sound.“You have to be quiet,” he warned, his breath hot against her temple.She bit his earlobe playfully. “Make me.”Daniel nearly growled.His cock was straining against his pants, aching to be inside her. With one swift movement, he rolled on top of her, pressing her down into the mattress.Sarah whimpered, spreading her thighs to welcome him, her fingers fumbling to undo the tie of his pants. Daniel yanked them down just enough to free his aching length, his cock thick and hard, already dripping.Sarah’s dress was already pushed up to her waist, leaving nothing between them. She was bare, slick, ready for him.“You’re already so wet,” he hissed against her ear, his fingers sliding through the heat between her thighs.Sarah arched, trembling. “It’s been too long, Daniel.”His lips found hers in a hungry, desperate kiss, swallowing her moan as he pushed inside. Hot. Tight. Home.Sarah gasped against his mouth, her hands clutching at his back, fingers digging in as he buried himself to the hilt.Above them—a sudden, unmistakable sound.A slow, rhythmic motion. Flesh against flesh.Daniel froze.Sarah whimpered beneath him, trying to rock her hips against his, but Daniel was still, his ears straining.He heard it again. A quiet, desperate groan. Luke was touching himself.Daniel’s cock twitched inside Sarah, his body betraying him.She must have felt it, because she smirked in the darkness, her voice a sultry whisper.“He’s listening to us,” she breathed against his lips.Daniel groaned, thrusting deep.Sarah bit her lip, muffling a moan, wrapping her legs around his waist.From above—a sharp, breathless exhale. Luke was getting closer.And so was Daniel.He gripped Sarah’s hips and began to move in earnest, driving into her, his cock sliding in and out of her slick, desperate heat.Sarah gasped, her fingers tangling in his hair, her body arching to take him deeper.Their bodies rocked the bunk bed, the rhythm unmistakable now.And above them—softer, faster strokes. Luke was jerking off to the sounds of their fucking.The ultimate taboo.Daniel should have stopped—but instead, he fucked his wife even harder. His hips slammed into Sarah’s, the creaking of the bunk bed drowning out the storm outside.Above them—faster, desperate strokes. Luke was close.And so was Daniel.His hands gripped Sarah’s thighs, spreading her wide as he thrust deep, harder than before.“Daniel,” she gasped, her fingers digging into his back. “Oh, God—”“Don’t take the Lord’s name in vain,” he growled into her ear, but his voice was thick with arousal.Sarah smirked, breathless. “Then give me something else to call out.”Daniel slammed into her.She bit her lip hard, her body trembling beneath him.Above them—Luke choked back a groan.Daniel could hear it—the wet, slick sounds of his friend’s hand working his cock.The taboo pleasure of it all only made Daniel’s own climax rush toward him like a dam about to burst.Sarah’s legs locked tight around his waist, her body convulsing beneath him. “Ohhh—Daniel, yes—”Her pussy clenched around his cock, and he was gone.With one last deep, brutal thrust, he spilled inside her, his release flooding her warmth.At the same moment—above them—Luke groaned softly, the bed shifting slightly, a wet, sticky sound accompanying his final strokes. Then…Silence.The only sound was the rain, the steady thrum against the roof as all three of them lay breathless in the dark.Daniel’s head dropped against Sarah’s shoulder.She kissed his temple, her fingers running through his damp hair.He thought he should feel guilt. He should feel shame. But all he felt was satisfaction.The work of the Lord was done.Hours later, the storm had passed. The early sun cast golden light through the small window, streaking across the wooden floor.Sarah stood at the table, her hair loose and wild, her dress still slightly wrinkled. Daniel sat across from her, sipping coffee, a knowing smirk playing on his lips.Luke stepped out of the small washroom, his face unreadable. He had barely spoken since waking, though his eyes had flicked toward Daniel more than once.Sarah glanced at him and smiled sweetly. “Sleep well, Luke?”Luke froze for half a second, his grip tightening on the cup in his hand.Daniel smirked. “Or did you wrestle with temptation in the night?”Luke exhaled a laugh, shaking his head. “You two are wicked.”Sarah tilted her head, feigning innocence. “The flesh is weak, Luke. We all stumble.”Luke’s lips twitched. “Some of us more than others,” he muttered, taking a sip of coffee.Daniel chuckled. “Well, brother, let’s just say—when a man sows, he must also reap.”Sarah bit her lip, suppressing a giggle.Luke shook his head, grabbing his coat. “I should get going.”Daniel stood, stretching, his shirt rising just slightly.“Go in peace,” he said, grinning.Luke shot him a look, then shook his head with a laugh. “You two need prayer.”Sarah smiled sweetly. “Pray for us, Luke. Long and hard.”Luke choked on his coffee.Daniel laughed loudly, wrapping an arm around his wife’s waist, pulling her close.As Luke walked out the door, he heard Sarah whisper something to Daniel.He didn’t catch it all—just the words “round two” and “the Lord is my shepherd.”Luke groaned, running a hand through his hair. Another long day in the mines.And a very long night ahead for Daniel and Sarah.
