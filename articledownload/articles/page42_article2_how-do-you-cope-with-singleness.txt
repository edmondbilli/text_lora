Hey, MH’ers, 34 year old virgin man here. I’ve never been in a relationship. I have been single so long, sometimes I wonder if I even still want that. Although I feel I really would like a family and definitely, definitely have the ‘drive’ for it. Lol.Two things:1. In general, I’m curious how the single folks on MH cope with not experiencing intimacy?2. For the Ladies, what qualities do you look for in a man? What ‘red flags’ do you look for?Thanks!
