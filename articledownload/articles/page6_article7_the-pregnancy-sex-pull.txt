As Alec and I retired to our bed, my desire for intimacy was as strong as ever.The gravitational force pulling me towards my pulsating core was irresistible. As I reached the fifth month of pregnancy, I reveled in the weight and joy of carrying our first child. My engorged clitoris throbbed eagerly, aching for release. The urge to make love with Alec consumed me at all times, an insatiable craving that could not be ignored.“Are you awake?” I asked.“Yes,” he replied.“I think there’s something going on with me,” I said.Concerned, he asked, “What’s wrong, baby?”“It’s this pregnancy,” I confessed. “I can’t stop thinking about sex. It’s like my body is constantly craving it. Orgasms help for a little while, but then the desire comes back even stronger. I find myself masturbating more often just to relieve the tension. I love the feeling of being horny and having orgasms, but it’s never enough. Maybe I’m some kind of sex addict or nymphomaniac. Is this normal?”I turned to him in search of reassurance, seeking his opinion on the intense arousal coursing through my body. His response only ignited a deeper desire within me.“Ashley, savor every orgasm you experience and dedicate them to me and God!”The sound of those words escaping from his mouth sent tingles down my spine and left me yearning for his touch even more.I opened up to Alec about my overwhelming sexual desires during pregnancy, both at home and at work. It all began with a simple attraction towards an attractive man on TV, which would turn into a wave of desire that I couldn’t resist satisfying myself to. Eventually, it became harder to control my urges at work, where I constantly fought the impulse to give men seductive looks or even touch myself when they spoke to me. One day, my boss approached me while I was dressed in a low-cut dress that exposed my cleavage. The thought of him admiring the view only intensified my sensations, and I couldn’t resist bringing myself to climax right there at my desk once he left. It was embarrassing and completely out of my control.Pregnancy certainly has a profound impact on one’s hormones and desires.As I confided in Alec, tears fell uncontrollably from my eyes.He responded simply, “You are hot, Ashley. Enjoy the ride.”Despite my erratic thoughts and behavior due to pregnancy, I was grateful to have someone who fully believed in me.“Alec,” I whispered, gazing into his eyes. “You are my love, and no matter what happens, I will always remain faithful to you.” Alex took my hand and guided it down to his erection—he was rock hard and ready for me.“Ash,” he groaned, pressing his body against mine. “I can’t resist you when you share your horny thoughts with me like that.”Alex’s other hand slid down to my wetness, making contact with my pulsating clit. In a matter of seconds, I went from the brink of tears to the brink of climax. But just as quickly as it started, he stopped.He leaned in close, his breath hot on my neck. He whispered, “Spread your legs for me.” I felt the heat rising to my cheeks as he added, “I want to see every inch of you, your pussy and that perfect little nub.”Despite feeling a bit uneasy, I gave in to his desires. He positioned himself between my spread legs and gazed at my pussy with hungry eyes while breathing heavily. Then, with his words, he painted vivid pictures of us together while instructing me to touch my own breasts. In his fantasy world, my boss was peering down my blouse, admiring me and saying how lucky my lover, Alec, was to have me.As he spoke, his intense gaze and heated breath sent shivers down my spine. My hands roamed eagerly, caressing my body in response to his words that were like a sweet torture. My fingers gently tugged at my erect nipples as I felt a powerful orgasm building within me. It was unlike any other experience, as if his every touch and word were igniting a fire within me. It was so hot, like our bodies were making love through his seductive whispers and my own passionate movements.“You like the attention from men,” he said with a knowing smirk. “But you would never act on it because of your love for me and your devotion to your faith.” He traced his finger down her jawline, sending shivers down her spine.I was stunned at how words had such a profound effect on me. As a girl of deep faith, I never thought they could have such power over me. But as he reminded me of our vows and our shared Christian beliefs, it only reinforced my commitment to maintaining boundaries in our marriage. It was liberating to realize that even my wildest thoughts were considered sacred within the sanctity of our union.As I continued to play with my breasts, I could feel an orgasm brewing.Alex joked, “Maybe your boss will get a good view down your shirt tomorrow. Maybe my pregnant wife will have a secret climax just from how horny you are.”With my hands still gently caressing my own breasts, I felt his eyes glued to me with a sense of awe. His breath tickled my sensitive skin and sent shivers down my spine. Without warning, a powerful wave of pleasure swept through my body in response to everything that was happening. It may not have been the most intense orgasm I’ve had since marrying Alec, but it was certainly unforgettable and unlike anything I had experienced before.Alec’s strong hands gently repositioned me, and as he entered me, I felt a wave of pleasure wash over me, his thrusts sending sensations through my body.Suddenly, another orgasm rushed over me with such intensity that I couldn’t contain my moans of pleasure. It was like fireworks exploding in my soul, mind and body, leaving me breathless and wanting more.After everything was said and done, we laid together in a loving embrace. I excused myself to use the restroom, but when I came back he had already drifted off to sleep. I, on the other hand, was still awake…and feeling aroused once again. My fingers slid down between my legs, where I could still feel the wetness from his earlier release. Without hesitation, I gave in to another climax as he slept soundly beside me. Afterward, I finally drifted off into a peaceful slumber as well.
