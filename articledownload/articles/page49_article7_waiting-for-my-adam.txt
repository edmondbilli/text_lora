Hello Everyone!I’m a single, 22-year-old woman. I have been a member of the site for a while now, but finally decided to write a post.I’m a virgin and cradle Catholic. I’ve never had a boyfriend, and I still haven’t experienced my first kiss. I’ve been waiting to experience those things with the right guy. I’m not waiting for a worldly and ordinary love. I’m looking for a love that’s built on God’s love. This of course, hasn’t been easy, but I know it will be worth it when I meet my future husband (My Adam).I’ve always wanted to be a wife and a mom. I’m so in awe of many of the couples on this site that have been married for over 30, 40, and 50 years. That’s unfortunately not as common as it used to be.There are so many aspects of my future marriage that I’m praying for, including our sex life. I want to fully bless, love, and give pleasure to my future husband—which leads me to some questions.How can I best prepare for a holy and loving sex life while I’m single? What books or podcasts do you recommend as good resources? How do you please your husbands in the bedroom?I look forward to writing more posts and learning from all of you. Thank you for welcoming me into this wonderful community, and I can’t wait for you all to get to know me through my stories.
