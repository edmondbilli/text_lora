In my sex research, I’ve heard two opposing views: many women seem to say that they want a guy with a big, or at least wide, penis; others say that penis size is actually not as important as technique, and that it can be uncomfortable if a guy is too big.Can both of these be true? Does it depend on the couple? For guys who are unusually small, how do you give your wives pleasure? Is it impossible, tough, or just needing more effort? Are there any men here on MarriageHeat who have had issues with size? What are your solutions?Personally, I would probably be fine with an erect cock that’s the size of the vibrator I got, which is about 4 or 5 inches long and fairly slim. (I’m not sure of the circumference.) Of course, I’m VERY tight, so that will play into it. I think it’s due to hypertension and the way my body stores stress. I wouldn’t be surprised if, should I ever marry, I may have to do pelvic floor therapy, especially if I get a more well-endowed guy.Anyhow, I’d love to hear back from any of the gents on this topic.
