Hi, y’all horny gals!Question: what is the best vibrator you’ve ever owned?  A number of years ago, my hubby purchased a Lelo Mia lipstick-style mini vibe for us to use. It has a built-in USB charger, which is great! Unfortunately, whenever we’re using it, it tends to come apart at the seam (it’s how you charge it), which is super frustrating!  I love that it’s small and discreet (looks like a tube of lipstick) but hate that it comes apart like that. Any other highly recommend vibes you’d encourage other women to try?Thanks so much! Can’t wait to hear your suggestions!Hugs,Booty
