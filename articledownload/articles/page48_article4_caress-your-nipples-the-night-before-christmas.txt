I arrived home on December 23 and commented on a MarriageHeat.com poll regarding the Hot Monogamy Lifestyle and masturbation. People encouraged me to share what happened after I caught my mom masturbating in preparation for a date with my dad, so I wrote the story. Writing the story was enjoyable and made me reflect on how I learned to self-pleasure and gain confidence in my sexual identity as a woman, as well as in giving and receiving pleasure.After I submitted the story to MH, I considered submitting more single-woman masturbation stories. Since I was 14, I kept a journal. I included times of masturbation and my thoughts in my journal. I found three journals from my teen years and started reading posts by my younger self. Some of my posts made me cringe, and I was surprised at how often I masturbated, influenced by both good and bad events.The diary entries spanned middle school, high school, parties, and breakups. I also read about the fantasies I had with my crush, Josh, who was my lab partner in chemistry class.It fascinated me to see how much I grew and evolved as a person and woman. I appreciated my openness and honesty while documenting my feelings and experiences. At the same time, I thought, “Oh my gosh, I was such a perv!” I still am, I guess.I chuckle, feeling embarrassed. In the story, I wrote about the day I caught my mom masturbating. I wrote, “You know, that whole ‘salad’ thing? It’s just a fun way to describe it. Not literally, though – I don’t eat salad while doing it!” Great memory! (Click hereto see the “Sexual Salad” story)I glance at the window, watching the snowflakes dance against the glass.Outside, the winter wonderland stretches as far as the eye can see. The snow-covered trees sway gently in the cold breeze, creating a serene landscape that whispers, “Welcome to Christmas Eve.” As I flip through the worn-out pages, I notice how my mother and father modeled a sex-positive attitude.The memories come flooding back – all the highs and lows, the laughter and tears, the dreams and fears.I add some scented candles to enhance the ambiance, filling the bathroom with a heady aroma of lavender and vanilla. As the water fills the tub, I strip off my clothes and look in the mirror.I look at myself. Earlier, I noticed a journal post where my mother told me to take time to look at myself. “Feel your ears. Outline your nose with your fingers. See your nipples. Caress your nipples… She encouraged me to learn how to love God’s creation of me. You cannot love others unless you learn how to love yourself. She mentioned that people believe that loving yourself and your body is somehow evil. Instead, love each moment you get to be here.Don’t look at your body to idolize it; love it in a way to serve it and “steward” God’s design of it. (My mother and father are ministers, using words like “steward”). You are unique and wonderfully made. If you do not see that, others will not.” She then went through the list of dangers. “Stay humble. Stay teachable. Think about others above yourself.”I turn the water off and continue to look at myself, seeing a naked woman in her early twenties.I say to myself, “Take a closer look at me. Feel my breasts. Caress my nipples. Look at my belly button. Touch my pubic hair. Feel my inner thigh. Run your fingers across your lips. Touch your clit. Stroke your vulva.”“Praise God, girl, you’re pretty sexy!” I exclaimed, breaking the silence of the room. My hands trace along my curves, feeling the softness of my skin. My fingers slide down my stomach, over my navel, and between my legs.I stand in front of the mirror and stroke my clit gently, savoring the sensation. The heat is building inside me, a slow burn that consumes my senses. I close my eyes, shutting out the world around me, focusing only on the feelings coursing through my body. Lost in the moment, I’m completely absorbed in the pleasure of my touch. My breathing deepens, becoming ragged and uneven. Pounding in my chest like a drumbeat, my heart races. My body aches with desire, yearning for release.I stop and get into the bathtub. I sink lower into the water, submerging my head beneath the surface. The water laps at my cheeks, cool and refreshing. I take a deep breath, inhaling the scent of lavender and vanilla. My lungs fill with air, and I exhale slowly, watching bubbles rise to the surface.As I lie in the tub, I can’t help but think about Mr. Right. What kind of man will he be? Will he be tall and muscular or thin and athletic? Will he have dark hair or light? Regardless of his physical attributes, I know one thing for sure. He will be a man, someone different from me. He will have his desires, and I will be eager to fulfill them.In my imagination, I create a Christmas scenario. I shut my eyes and picture coming home with my new husband for Christmas. I don’t have a specific person in mind, but I know he is passionate. He delights in appreciating the beauty of a woman’s body and celebrates it with his eyes.I envision my father at the door, greeting us as we walk in. He thinks, “This man is lucky! My daughter looks stunning.” My mother hugs me and embraces my new husband as well. She smiles at me, thinking, “Mr. Right looks genuinely happy with my daughter.” My husband, in turn, thinks, “Your mother looks amazing for 48. I think the same.”As I enjoy my bath in this scenario, my fingers start caressing my breasts and nipples. As I touch and caress my body, my scenario transitions into sexual snapshots. In one scene, Mr. Right slips his hand up my dress at the dinner table, teasingly stroking my pussy. Then, my imagination takes us into the bathroom, where Mr. Right takes me from behind as I bend over, holding onto the counter and looking into the mirror.My fingers are now circling my clit. Next shot. Mr. Right is watching me pleasure myself.“Ah, this feels so good,” I murmur, sinking deeper into the tub. The candlelight flickers on the walls, casting a soft golden hue over the room.My hands move down to my thighs, tracing along the smooth skin, almost as if I can feel Mr. Right’s gentle touch, soothing my nerves and calming my racing heart. I sigh softly, my muscles relaxing further into the warm water.“I hope you’re out there, Mr. Right,” I whisper, staring into the flickering shadows of the candlelight.My fingers trail downwards, brushing past my hips and onto my inner thighs. The soft-touch sends a tingle up my spine, and I arch my back instinctively, reveling in the delicious sensation.“Mmm,” I sigh, my voice floating on the warm, humid air. I lean back slightly, allowing the water to support my weight. My eyes flutter closed, and I focus solely on the intimate contact with my body.“Mr. Right,” I moan as my fingers reach my most sensitive spot.I press harder, rubbing my clit with increasing urgency. My heart races, pounding in my chest like a war drum. My breath comes in short, sharp gasps, echoing in the quiet bathroom. The tension builds, mounting with every exquisite touch. I can feel myself teetering on the edge, ready to plunge into the abyss of pleasure. I moan, closing my eyes and letting my head fall back against the rim of the tub.My climax is building, and I cannot and do not want to stop it. My breathing grows heavy, my pulse races and my fingers become slick with arousal. I stroke my clit faster, harder, desperate for release. I cry out, my voice echoing in the empty bathroom. “Yes, yes, oh God, YES!”Wow! What a great way to start my Christmas break. I am looking forward to reading more Marriage Heat stories. I may have time to submit another one or two. Who knows what fantasies await?
