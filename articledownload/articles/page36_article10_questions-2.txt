So, I got aFleshlight.My penis has a significant downward bend in the middle, more or less like a boomerang. It works fine for me, but I’m not sure how to make it work for a woman. The pressure points are the underside of the head and the top side in the middle at the bend.I was reading online that with a downward bend, positions from behind are the best. And that you use the underside of the head to put pressure on the G-spot. However, in the Fleshlight the G-spot is about 0.5 inches inside. Trying to hit that place with the end of the penis causes it to slip out all the time. I’m not sure how this is supposed to work.Second, I held the Fleshlight at about 30 to 60 degrees from my torso and thrust up towards the top of it. I found the top side of the bend can put a lot of pressure on the wall of the Fleshlight. It’s like a two‐stage trigger. The first half goes in pretty easy, then you hit the wall and then it suddenly releases. I’m not sure if this is something to learn to avoid or to master. Also, I’m not sure how much pressure on the wall feels good?Third, I tried a condom to see what that felt like. It took a lot more lube and rapidly dried out. And I had to be gentle, otherwise the condom would tear. Is this a typical experience, or am I doing this wrong?One last thing, reading online it’s all about the clit, G-spot, and the elusive A-spot. However, I get the impression from stories on this site that it is a lot more nuanced than that. Is that correct?Thanks in advance.
