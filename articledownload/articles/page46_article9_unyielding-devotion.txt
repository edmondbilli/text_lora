He had lit a spark that had ignited her sexual awareness. Andrea had become more curious, wanting to explore their shared kinks together. So, as she heard the shutter and screech of the antiquated elevator rise from the apartment lobby to their penthouse on the 5th floor, she sprang into action, wanting to return the compliment to the man who had started the fire within her.Gabriel placed his key in the lock, turned it and heard the tumblers click. He pushed and heaved the heavy door open. He was struck by a vision that sent the blood rushing to his groin.Andrea was kneeling before the picture window that framed a perfect view of the Parisian rooftops. She glowed in the twinkling lights of the city. Andrea wore black stockings and suspenders, black kickers and a matching bra that cocooned her breasts, pushing them up and accentuating her cleavage. Her black hair was pulled back tight in a bun, and she wore black lipstick. Over her eyes, she wore a black leather blindfold, and around her neck, she wore a matching collar with a large silver hoop at the front.As Gabriel approached, her head moved, and she sensed his presence.“Master”, she said in a deep, sexy voice, her lips parting to reveal her perfect white teeth and red tongue.“Andrea,” He replied, his voice deep and throaty with arousal.“Master is happy with his slave?” She asked, her voice quivering slightly, betraying her nerves.“Master is pleased,” he confirmed, getting into his part.“A gift for my Master,” she said, raising her arms. Andrea held a leather leash in one hand and a sizeable pink rabbit in the other.Gabriel felt a wave of excitement pulse through him. This was new.He took the leash from her and hooked it onto the ring in the centre of her collar. Gabriel pulled the leash up, and Andrea had no option but to lift her head where she met his lips. His tongue pierced her mouth, and he kissed her deeply“Up” he commanded as they parted.Andrea got to her feet and stood before him, her shoulders back and her hands clasped behind her back.“Turn”Andrea spun slowly, the heels of her shoes tapping on the floor, allowing Gabriel to survey her body. He reached forward and traced his fingers over the lace of her bra and the soft flesh of her breasts. He ran his hands down her sides, feeling the curves of her waist and the fullness of her hips. His fingers lingered on the straps of her suspenders as his eyes followed their line over her shapely thighs and the swell of her bottom.He could feel his cock growing as he surveyed his beautiful wife and pet.He walked her closer to the window and turned her so her back faced the Paris night sky.“Kneel” he commanded.Andrea gracefully descended to the floor, her eyes never leaving the spot she knew his eyes were.Gabriel reached behind him, grabbed a chair and sat down before her. He looked down at her body. He was struck by an idea and decided to run with it.“On all fours.”She did as instructed.Gabriel removed his belt and folded it over in his hand.“Head up,” he barked.Again, she did as instructed.The next order made her wince slightly, but she did not flinch.“Bum up”She did as commanded, lifting her rear off the ground. Andrea could feel the heat in her face; knowing she was blushing, it was not lost on her that she was blushing twice, once for her embarrassment and a second time for being embarrassed about her embarrassment.“Arch your back,” he barked.He saw her spine flex and the curve of her backside become more pronounced.“Now lower yourself.”Andrea lowered herself towards the ground, feeling her ass push out further and her weight on the balls of her feet and her knees.“Lower” he commanded.Andrea pushed her chest down, her face now on the floor, and her rear end lifted high in the air.“Higher,” he demanded, his voice a little huskier now.Andrea pushed her feet away from her and stretched her body, arching her back and pushing her arse as high into the air as she could. She could feel her mound becoming wet as she realised how exposed she was.Gabriel’s eyes were feasting on the sight before him. He could see the wetness on her thighs and smell her fragrance. His cock was rock hard, and he was enjoying the view.He stood and, with his hand, pushed her shoulders to the floor, making sure her ass stayed high in the air.Standing just inches away, he walked to the window and looked down at her.“Spread your legs.”Andrea moved her right foot to the side and then her left, widening her stance.“Wider”Andrea shuffled her knees and legs further apart, exposing herself more.“Stay.”“Yes, Master” she replied.The sting of the leather against the exposed skin of her bum made Andrea cry out loudly. She had expected him to start softly, but Gabriel had jumped right in. The pain was intense, and it shot through her like electricity, causing her muscles to contract and her eyes to water. She could feel her cheeks and eyes begin to flush, and she breathed deeply, trying to control her breathing and stop herself from crying.“Another, Sir,” she said.He swung again, landing the leather in the same spot as the first.Andrea grunted, and her eyes watered even more.“Count” Gabriel demanded.“Two, Master,” Andrea said, her voice cracking with emotion.“Good petShe heard the belt whistle as it cut through the air and then the loud crack as it smacked into her bare flesh.“Three Master”Another and another came in quick succession.“Five Master, Thank you, Master,” Andrea called out.Andrea felt him crouch behind her. She was surprised when his tongue found her arse hole through her panties. She felt him lick along the length of the crack, his breath warm through the material. It caused her to shudder with pleasure as his soft hands caressed her thighs and touched her skin.Gabriel’s fingers grasped the thin material of the thong, and as he stood, he pulled it, ripping the gusset of the knickers apart. She felt him run the length of the belt between her legs.“You made my belt wet!” he exclaimed.“Sorry, Master” she responded.“Lick it clean.”Andrea took the leather into her mouth, tasting it herself. Gabriel had placed his hand on the small of her back, holding her firm and preventing her from moving as she sucked the leather and tasted her own juices.“You are a bad girl,” Gabriel stated.“I’m sorry, Master.”“Are you a dirty slut”“Yes, Master.”“Tell me”“I am a dirty slut, Master.”“Say it louder.”“I am a dirty slut!”“Louder”“I am a dirty, dirty slut!”The searing pain of the blow made her cry out loud once more.“Six,” she said as the tears rose under the blindfold. ”Thank you, Master,” she managed, her voice breaking.The belt had two effects: the first, the pain of the sting sending her body into tight muscle flinches and then the pleasure of sensation sending her mind to some far-off euphoric state. Andrea felt Gabriel walk away from her. She felt vulnerable and alone.“Sit,” he commanded.She pushed herself back on her heels and then sat on her bum. She could feel the burning sensation of the blows Gabriel had landed.“Hold out your hands.”Andrea did as she was told and then felt the leash strap begin to wrap around her wrists, binding her.“Open your legs.”Andrea did as she was told.Gabriel slid the lead between her legs, and he pulled it tight.As he pulled the leash from behind, it brought her hands down towards her crotch, bringing her body down and her arse towards him.“Don’t move,” Gabriel said.Gabriel dropped his trousers and knelt between her legs. He rubbed his cock up and down her slit, feeling the moisture as it teased her. He pushed himself into her, feeling her slick wetness. Gabriel could see the strain on her face as she tried to push back against him. As she rocked forward, Gabriel pulled the leash with force, pulling her back like a yoyo.“Fuck me” he commanded.Andrea began to move her hips, fucking back against him and grinding herself on his shaft. She could feel his hands on her hips and then cupping her breast, pulling her erect nipple through her bra. She felt the bite of the clasp as he snapped it open, the material falling free and exposing her naked flesh.“Faster”Andrea began to buck against Gabriel’s lap, pushing him deeper and harder inside her.“Fuck me harder.”Andrea began to grind herself against him, feeling the pressure of him deep within her.“You are a dirty slut, aren’t you?” he asked, his voice harsh.“Yes, Master.”“Tell me you are a dirty slut!”“I am a dirty slut, Master.”“I can’t hear you.”“I am a dirty fucking slut, Master.”“That’s what I thought.”Gabriel could feel his body stiffen. He pulled Andrea towards him, feeling her pussy’s heat enveloping him.“Do you want me to cum?” he asked.“Please, Master, yes.”“Beg me”“Please, Master, please cum”“I can’t hear you.”“Oh, Master, please, I beg you to cum.”“Why?”“Because I’m a dirty fucking slut who likes it.”“You are a fucking whore, aren’t you?” he gasped.“Yes, Master.”“Tell me you’re a whore!”“I’m a whore Master.”“You are a dirty little fuck slut, aren’t you?”“Yes, Master.”“You don’t deserve me to cum yet, whore,” he said and, in one fast motion, pulled out and pushed her to one side.“Roll onto your front.”Andrea rolled over, her hands still tied together and the leash keeping her pussy raised in the air.Gabriel stood and walked back along the hallway, retrieving the pink Rabbit from the hall table he had left it on. He turned it on as he walked back to her, lying on the floor before the large window. Andrea Turned her face towards the new buzzing sound.“Face the wall,” he said.“Yes, Master.”“You don’t deserve the rabbit, do you?”“No Master”“Say it.”“I don’t deserve the rabbit, Master.”Gabriel held the vibrator to the inside of her thigh.“Please, Master” Andrea pleaded.“Ask me properly.”“Master, will you use it on me, please?”“Beg.”“Oh, Master, please use the rabbit on me.”“Why should I?”“Because I am a dirty slut who likes it. I’m your slave, Your bitch, your fuck slut. Because I’m your whore.”Gabriel pressed the vibrator shaft between the glistening lips of Andrea’s snatch. She moaned and writhed as the vibrations sent shock waves over her body, making her spine tingle and hum like a neon light.“Yes”“Yes, Master.”“Yes, Master!”“Yes, Master!”Gabriel began to thrust along the length of her mound, her lips swelling up around it as he moved it faster and faster along her slit. His hand slid under her body, and his fingers began to fret her clit. His other hand moved the tip of the Rabbit to the entrance of her heat. Gabriel let the tip dance just at the gateway to her vagina, her muscles wanting to be spread by the toy. As Gabriel’s fingers rubbed her clit between his thumb and pointer finger, she felt the vibrating toy breach her vagina and slide effortlessly into her in one swift plunge.She shouted “Yes, Master!” .“Yes, Master.”“Fuck.”“Yes, Master!”“Fuck!!! Yes! Yes!! FUCK!!!!”She screamed out as she felt the pleasure tearing through her, making her tremble, her arms and legs shaking uncontrollably. Her back arched, her muscles tightening and relaxed as he let the toy glide in and out of her pussy. Andrea felt her heart beating wildly in her chest, her pulse throbbing in her neck, and a cold sweat breaking out on her brow.“I am very close, Master may I cum?” she asked.“Not yet slut”Gabriel turned the toy off and withdrew it from her. Andrea’s whole body shook.“No, please don’t stop. Oh god, I am so close. Master, I beg you, let me cum.”“No”“But Master, I need to cum. Oh, please.”“Not yet.”“Please, Master, I can’t take anymore.“Be quiet.”Andrea slumped onto the floor and bit her bottom lip. She lay there exposed on the floor, wanting to cry.“Open your mouth,” he ordered.She opened her mouth.“Now, stick out your tongue.”Andrea obeyed.Gabriel slid the head of his penis across her tongue. He rubbed his shaft back and forth along the length of her tongue, his precum leaving a glistening trail as it wept from his head.“Now suck”Andrea took him deep in her mouth, his shaft hard and the skin soft. She tasted the saltiness of his juice and savoured the feeling of his manhood in her mouth. He grasped her head by the neat bun at the back and fucked her mouth with his cock. She worked her tongue along the underside of his shaft with every penetration of his rod in her mouth.“That’s it, take it all, slut.”Andrea gagged slightly, her eyes watering under the blindfold.He pulled his cock from her mouth and slapped it against her face.“You have made my belt wet,”He slapped his cock against her mouth and followed it up with a spank of his belt on her calf.“You have made your panties wet.”Another slap of his dick on her face and yet another wincing crack of the belt on her thigh.“You have made me wet,” he said, sliding his cock back into her mouth. Andrea’s mouth closed around his shaft as she felt the pain of the strike that smacked her mound. The pain surged through her before melting into a sense of euphoria.“Again, Master,” she mumbled, her mouth full and her lips stretching.Gabriel struck her mound, and she sucked on his shaft.“Again”He smacked her pussy, and her teeth grated the length of his cock.“Again, Master, please.”Once more, he struck her mound. Again, she sucked on his manhood.“Again, harder”Gabriel’s hand cracked against her pussy, and Andrea’s teeth bit down on his cock.“I’m going to cum,” she moaned.“Not yet.”“Master, please.”“Shut up”Gabriel withdrew his cock from her mouth and looked at Andreas, exposed for his pleasure against the night skyline. She was panting, her breasts moving rapidly, her face flush. The muscles in her thighs twitched, and he saw her legs quivering. He could smell the sweet scent of her sex and knew he had her where he wanted her. He could feel his orgasm building, and he knew it was time.Gabriel stretched out one of Andrea’s legs and held the other against his chest. Her mound glistened in the light, and he took great pleasure watching his cock slide into her. With the other hand, he moved the Rabbit’s vibrating head and placed it firmly against Andreas’s clitoris.Her whole body convulsed as he fucked and vibrated her clit simultaneously.“Cum for me, whore”It was almost instant Andrea began to scream, her voice loud and high-pitched. The noise she made was a mixture of a squeal, a howl, a moan, and a whimper. Her body went rigid and then shuddered violently. She felt a sudden release, the tension in her body evaporating, her body relaxing and then the rush of warmth and tingling sensation that ran through her and made her toes curl.Gabriel removed his dick in and out of her cunt. He snaked his hips, making them move erratically inside her as he fought the control of his own orgasm.Andrea’s arms went slack, her eyes rolled back in her head, and the leash fell from her grasp. Gabriel knew she was in the sub-state she desired.“Where are you?” he whispered.“In a happy place,” she responded weekly.“Good girl,” Gabriel said as he withdrew the vibrator and threw it to one side. He untied the leash from her hands and threw it to one side. He could tell from the slackness in her body and her far-off expression she was in a complete state of subspace.“I still need to cum, whore.” he whispered into her ear.“Yes, Master, use me, Master. I’m yours, Master,” she muttered.Gabriel flipped Andrea onto her front and spread her legs, positioning himself between them.He slid his cock along the length of her bum, and she wiggled beneath him, her eyes still closed, her expression content. As he grasped his shaft, he could feel his cock eager to perform.He placed the tip of his cock at the entrance to her puckered hole and began to push gently.“I want your arsehole, Slut.” he told her.“Please, Master.”“Beg me”“Use my arsehole, please, Master.”“I can’t hear you.”“Please, Master, use my dirty little hole. Fill my arse, make me scream.”“You want to be my little slut, don’t you?”“Oh, yes, Master, I want you to use me. I want to be your slut.”“Tell me”“I want to be your dirty, filthy, fucking little whore.”Andrea began to writhe, rubbing herself against the floor, her hands grasping the material of the rug beneath her.Gabriel pressed his cock into her and felt the pressure give way, her arsehole expanding and letting him into her.“Oh fuck, I love having your big hard cock in my arse” she called out.Gabriel thrust his shaft in and out of her.“My dirty whore. You’re a good fuck aren’t you.”“Yes, Master. Your whore. Your good fuck.”“You like it, don’t you?”“Oh god, yes, please, Master.“Do you want more?”“Yes, Master. Use me, please, Master!”As Gabriel’s balls banged against Andrea’s body, they began to tingle, a heat spreading across his body as he felt his climax rising.Andrea grasped onto the wall, trying to hold herself still, open, and high for her Master as he fucked her arse. She could feel his cock sliding in and out, the pressure on her arsehole making her pussy tremble. Her breathing was rapid, and she gasped with each thrust.“I’m going to cum, Master.”“Me too.”“May I?”“Not yet Bitch”“Please, Master, please.”“No”“Oh fuck, Oh FUCK”Andrea’s whole body tensed, and Gabriel’s hands gripped her hips, pulling her tight against him. She felt him spasm inside her, his seed squirting deep into her arse.“OH! YES, FUCK YES!”“Cum,” Gabriel said, and it was like the gates of heaven were flung open. Her mind, her body and her soul released, she cried out.“OH! FUCK!”Her orgasm exploded through her. Her arms gave way, and her torso dropped to the floor. As she lay there, her legs fell to the side. Gabriel, still embedded within her, felt her body tighten around his cock as he slumped on top of her.As Gabriel slipped his cock out of her arse, he saw Andrea’s eyes roll in her head once more, and she slipped back into her happy, euphoric sub-space once more. Before they embarked on this more assertive lifestyle, after that afternoon at the Intercontinental Hotel, Gabriel would never have guessed how Andrea would love being pushed to the extreme of pleasure and pain.He also knew how important it was to look after his love. Bending down, he scooped her up and carried her to their bedroom.He lay her on the bed, unclasped the leash and unbound her blindfold. Entering the bathroom, he filled a basin with warm water and grabbed a towel and washcloth. He cleaned her down with the washcloth, drying her as he went.The last thing he did was remove her collar and massage her neck where it had bitten in.She moaned.Gabriel lay beside her, his arm draped over her as he held her tightly as she drifted in and out of a beautiful sleep.
