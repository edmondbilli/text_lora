(L) – This story contains strong language.This was written as my wife slept this morning. She needed rest from a busy Pre-Christmas and busy Christmas Day. She looked so peaceful that I did not wake her, even though today was a scheduled sex day. (We have full sex every three days or so.)We had enjoyed our “Christmas sex session” on Christmas Eve Eve and it had been a doozy with oral both ways and monster orgasms. Now it was three days later—Boxing Day. But I let my Melody sleep and wrote the following poem on my cell phone.**********Poem: Boxing DayI want to stretch out your pussyAnd fuck you so deepBut you look so peacefulIn your post holiday sleepYour lovely eyes are closedBut I want your pussy to open upBut first I will feastOn your perfect D cupsMany years agoYou gave me your cherryBut I still get to love onEach sexy raspberryEach rosy raspberryIs your nipple hard and firmAnd loving on themMakes my passion burnSo wake up dearest wifeMy dick’s at full powerAnd I know you will firstWant a pussy-cleansing showerThen we’ll suck ‘n we’ll lickAnd use vibrators tooAnd while we are heavy pettingI’ll hear your soft sexy cooYou also love toSuck on my man nipsAs much as I loveTo suck on your womanly titsI’ll rub your sweet clitGently with my handAnd “Go inside me”You soon will demandBut first I’ll switch boobsTo your left treasure chestThere is no doubt that IEnjoy your ample breastsThen into X positionWe next will goInto a pounding pussy fuckThat is fast ‘n not slowI’ll soon fill your cuntWith my milky love creamThen back to your tittiesMy mouth will focus like a beamBut first I must scoopA bit of our cumFrom your tender leaking pussyThat just gave me such sexy funThen I’ll rub the cumOn your nearest titYour nipple will taste greatAnd be as hard as she getsYou’ll be using your ivibeTo pleasantly buzz your clitWhen your orgasm takes youYour fire will be fully litMore like hot plasmaThan just a chemical fireAnd you shake when you comeLike an earthquake that’s direThen we will cuddleEmbraced by our loveAnd thank our FatherIn Heaven aboveBecause He gave you to meAnd gave me to youAnd in some ways when we make loveIt still feels kind of newYet we know each otherSo very very wellWe were best friendsEven before the wedding bellsBut our familiarityDoes not breed contemptWe often love on each otherUntil we’re fully spent**********Melody woke up. We laid on our sides cuddling with my head resting at the side of her waist as I ran my hand all over her shapely buns. I swear they are getting sexier!After I read her the poem it really was too late to have a full lovemaking session. (We had family over from out of state.) But my sweet Melody complimented my poem and pulled her beautiful breasts out of her Christmas PJ top to offer me each raspberry to orally love on. I soon was erect so she moved to MY nipples as I used my male vibrating stroker on my engorged cock. I came like a train!
