Part One in a series called “Erotica for the Rest of Us.” This one is a short poem, but we would like to write full-length stories in the future.  Dedicated to all wives who struggle with vaginismus.It is raining in New EnglandIt is flooding in FranceThere are tsunamis in IndiaYet here we sit in our desertIn the shadow of a cactusDrink, my belovedDrink deeply.There is not muchBut it is all we haveShall we despair because we have not rainBecause we have not an ocean?We shall enjoy what we haveIt is not raining hereBut this is enoughNo one knows the sweet taste of agave but us.
