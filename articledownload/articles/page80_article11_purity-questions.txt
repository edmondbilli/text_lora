My wife and I both grew up very conservative. She was a virgin when we got married. I had been married before, but my first wife went to be with God at the age of 24.My new wife and I both masturbated before marriage; I had “beaten the meat” every day for years. After being married for a while, I began to watch porn and masturbate. It became somewhat of an addiction.Then I found this site and also SOTB. That became too much. I joined a group for sex addicts. They are extreme in my opinion. Personally, I can masturbate without porn or thinking about sex. They say masturbation is a sin because of what you think about while doing it.I do agree that masturbation can be an addiction to the release of hormones in the brain. Like anything, you can abuse it in order to release endocrines, etc. to deal with stress. I know that here, some people are too liberal for me.I am looking for a balanced approach. Is it wrong to read stories here and masturbate in order to release endorphins, etc.? My wife’s biggest concern is that I do it alone without her and/or don’t let her know. I won’t get into our sex life yet. I want her to read things here and also be adventurous, but she just isn’t. We can discuss that later.
