I went the prepare your fields then build your house route. While I succeeded, the problem is that it took about 10 years and I basically missed the boat. The women I know are already taken, way too young for me (I’m 34), or I don’t want them to treat me the way they treated their first husband.Online there seems to be a lot of women who also missed the boat, but I have never met one in real life. I’m not sure if they’re real or just posting for attention. Also, it seems like most Christian women are into hearing God. Most of the problems in my family are due to this stuff which is basically the occult with Christian icing on top. It causes people to switch sides at just the wrong moment for maximum damage. You can’t convince me to marry someone who is into this stuff after the messes I’ve seen it produce.So it seems like my options are win the lottery, pick a women who doesn’t really follow God and hope she changes, or stay single. Should I just move on from trying to find someone?Sorry if this post seems rushed, I’ve never been one to act like I’m related to Nebuchadnezzar.
