Hello, MarriageHeat. I could use some advice.Having grown up in the purity culture, I still carry a lot of that baggage. I don’t really know what to do. Off and on for several years, I’ve tried to get more comfortable accepting myself as a sexual being—with little success. I feel guilty when I’m aroused, when I am attracted to a woman, when I think of masturbation.I’ve gone back and forth on my views about written erotica, pornography, masturbation, and what’s appropriate to talk about vs. bury. The truth is, I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m around 30, and I’m tired. No matter what I do, it feels “wrong”, and I cannot talk to anyone about this stuff because of the sensitive nature.As I said, I’m tired. Tired of sometimes being on the verge of tears when I’m aroused, tired of suppressing my natural sexual desires, tired of feeling guilty if I don’t suppress them.I have no idea what to do at this point. What are your thoughts? And thank you in advance.
