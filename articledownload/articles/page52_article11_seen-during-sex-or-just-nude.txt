We have seen this issue come up in some stories from time to time. I want to start a discussion thread where we can share the times that someone has accidentally seen you and your spouse during sex. Or even just seen you or your spouse nude, individually or together.How did it happen? How did you handle it? How did they handle it?We can exclude purposeful times when seen nude. This could include doctor visits, or medical care, and nude beaches.For Moderators: please put it under “Discussion”
