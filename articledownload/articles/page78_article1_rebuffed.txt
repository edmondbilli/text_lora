Hi, all.I have been a long-time reader of MH—about nine years. I am a Christian man in my fifties, faithfully married to the same woman long enough to have grown children. My problem is that we don’t have sex. To put that in perspective, we’ve had sex five times in five years. She’s just not interested—at all. She will make suggestive comments and innuendos sometimes, but nothing ever comes from it.I know you must be wondering about all the possible reasons this could be, and I’ve thought about them also. (And forgive my slightly jaded comment here, but sometimes it just isn’t the man’s fault.) I’ve tried all the things, I’ve said all the things, and I’ve done all the things that preachers and professionals suggest, but to no avail. I have been rebuffed so many times that I just don’t try anymore.My drive is still very high. It’s not just the sex I need, either; I miss the connection. I can take the edge off with masturbation occasionally, but she doesn’t agree with that, so I can’t tell her. (Is it a sin because it’s kept secret?) I’m not looking for greener pastures, nor am I looking for an excuse to sin, but what am I supposed to do? I know the Lord promises a way to escape, but what exactly is that? (Oh, and marriage counseling is not an option either.)
