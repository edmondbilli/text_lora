As an early twenties single Christian woman who has a high sex drive, I do enjoy masturbation and fantasizing about my future husband, “Mr Right.” My parents encouraged me to enjoy my body and take responsibility for my happiness as a woman and, hopefully, as a wife and mother someday.I started touching myself at around 12; at around that time, my mother gave me the first talk, and those talks continued through my teen years. She started with the essentials, but she cooked up a “food” metaphor.She explained that our bodies are created with specific purposes, highlighting the connection between sexual pleasure and reproduction as part of divine design. She emphasized that God has instilled different sexual characteristics in men and women. For example, a man, like your father, has a penis that is designed to become erect, complementing a woman’s body. She also mentioned that women, including you and I, have vaginas, which she referred to as a pussy, to accommodate this aspect of physical love. She stated that the sensation of pleasure in what is commonly known as sex or lovemaking is a natural part of this design.She cautioned against the dangers of pornography, comparing it to sugar candy that, while initially appealing, ultimately harms your sex drive. She likened this to how candy might taste good initially but can lead to tooth decay. She shared that both she and her father have learned this through their experiences. (Having seen some pornography myself, I understand her point. It can make one feel sexually restless, similar to the effect of candy. While masturbation may temporarily relieve this anxious tension, it often leaves a feeling of emptiness. It’s a cycle where the immediate gratification only leads to a craving for more, much like a continual desire for more candy.)We had many talks about the biology of sex. In Mom’s first talk, Mom mentioned that men’s erect penis shoot out sperm and that if a man shoots sperm into a woman, this sperm may fertilize a woman’s egg. “That’s how I got pregnant with you, honey.” I was amazed.Mom asked if I noticed pleasure when I touched myself down there? I admitted I did. She taught me about the “clit” the power center for woman’s pleasure. She said that when you feel it and keep touching it, a feeling of intense pleasure will come over you; that is called a “climax.” This is a blessing to women that can happen more than once after the first one. Mom clarified that there is nothing like a man’s love tool inside your pussy. She called it the main meal of sex! God designed you to enjoy a man and his love tool. She later talked about how Genesis says, “Two shall be one flesh.”She mentioned that in our society, masturbation is personal and private until you are married, then it can include your husband. She mused somewhere in my teens that she masturbates alone and with my dad, and so does dad. And this masturbation enhances their lovemaking.During my teenage years, we frequently discussed the topic of masturbation. My mom likened masturbation, especially when done without the use of pornography and instead using one’s imagination, to a salad – nourishing but not the main meal. She also acknowledged the possibility that I might choose not to marry, suggesting that a woman can be content with ‘salads’ in the absence of marriage. She advised me to steer clear of ‘fast food,’ a metaphor she used for casual sex and one-night stands, cautioning about their potentially unsatisfying nature. Observing some of my friends who chose this path, I understood her perspective, as they didn’t seem to find lasting satisfaction in such experiencesWe had this funny moment when I was about 16. I came home early and surprised Mom while she was masturbating on the couch. Mom had her hand up her dress, and she was caressing her tits over her bra-less dress, and she was clearly climaxing. I saw, and I walked to my room to give her privacy. After a little bit, she called my name. She was aware I accidentally observed this. Her face was flush. I distinctly remember her saying she was enjoying a salad before your father and she went out. She said she was planning on “steak” later. With that, she saw I was getting uncomfortable. “STOP MOM!” I did blurt out, Mom, you’re not wearing a bra tonight???. She said, and no panties, either. “STOP MOM!” Deep down, I felt happy and hoped that someday, I could have a salad before a steak like this.That night, I decided to touch myself, like Mom did. I lay down on my bed in my pajamas, thinking about my future husband, a composite of crushes in my class. I closed my eyes and imagined Mr Right kissing me passionately and touching me gently. His hands were soft yet firm, making me shiver with excitement.As I slid my fingers under my pajama pants, I could feel the warmth of my skin. The sensation caused my heart to race faster, and my breath quickened. I rubbed my clit gently, teasing myself, wanting to prolong the pleasure.As the sensation intensified, I couldn’t help but think about Mr. Right’s lips on mine, his hands exploring my body. He kissed me passionately, running his hands down my back, then sliding them underneath my shirt. Feeling his warm hands on my bare skin sent chills down my spine.“Oh, Mr. Right” I moaned softly, biting my lip to stifle my cries. I moved my fingers faster, pressing harder against my clit. I knew I was close. I wanted to scream, but I didn’t want anyone to hear me. Mom and Dad were now home and I could not help imagine what they were up to!Instead, I dug my nails into the sheets and pressed my thighs together, trying to muffle the sounds escaping my mouth. The intensity built within me, and I began to shake uncontrollably. My heart raced, pounding against my chest, threatening to burst free. Suddenly, everything seemed to stop. I reached the climax, and it felt amazing. The wave of ecstasy washed over me, leaving me trembling and gasping for air.As I lay there, panting heavily, I realized I was sweating profusely. I glanced at the clock on my nightstand, noticing it was almost midnight. This began an adventure of sexual curiosity that continues to this day.
