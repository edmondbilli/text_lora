Hi, all. I’m new to MarriageHeat and have enjoyed reading some of the stories everyone has written. I’m 19 years old and recently discovered this site; it has been an interesting discovery. I have struggled with porn through my teenage years, and I’m trying to remain clean and work to glorify God and better myself instead of watching porn. It has been a journey, but by the grace of God, I’m hoping and praying that I stay away from that poison.That being said, I am still a pretty horny guy; I just have to be honest. I crave sex, and I look forward to the day when I marry the woman God has chosen just for me and get to enjoy the beautiful gift of marriage and sex. I do struggle with that sexual temptation, though, and I guess I’m writing this to ask for advice and for prayers. I want to glorify God, and I want to better myself. I just ask that those who read this would pray for me. I know none of us know each other, but I still ask anyway.While I haven’t been watching porn, I’m also trying to avoid masturbation because single masturbation is something I don’t support. I believe it will lead to lust and lead me down the path to porn. But I am still just SO HORNY some days.Now, this is probably weird for some people, but there are times that I hear my parents having sex, and I can’t help but be turned on by it—just thinking about having sex in the future. I guess I’m sharing this and making this account to share my thoughts with you all. Maybe I’ll describe my thoughts in later posts, but I just wanted to share my introduction and ask for your prayers. I hope all of you have a great day. I know this isn’t a super sexy post, so sorry about that. I hope you have a blessed day.
