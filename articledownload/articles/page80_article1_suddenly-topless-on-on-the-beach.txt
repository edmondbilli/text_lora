Only a quick story here …Something interesting happened to Jim and I during one of our recent beach trips.Since we live in central Florida, we hit the beach frequently. We enjoy cruising around in our old 1975 Chevy van. It has come in handy many times when the urge hit us and we couldn’t wait for spontaneous sex.It can be very cold in late January. We caught a break two weeks ago and went to sun our buns (and more) in Sarasota. Believe it or not, Jim has a much bigger problem hiding his excitement than I do. Though I get very wet at the beach from the people scenery, it’s not a problem to show dampness. Jim, on the other hand, has a huge problem hiding his excitement.On this particular day, I talked very dirty to him and flashed him a few times (top and wet pussy). So he was stranded on the sand with a towel covering his tent. I pulled his towel off a few times to expose his hard cock outline ;).In the late afternoon, visitors began to leave due to the sudden appearance of dark clouds. A powerful gust of wind lifted my untied bikini top completely off me, while I was laying on my back! Jim laughed very loudly and refused to go the ten yards to bring it back to me. So I grabbed his towel, uncovered his hard-on, and scurried down the beach to retrieve my top. This seemed to delight several of the men and women nearby!Final chapter: we headed out to the parking lot, where I tamed his beast and sat on his face. I ground my pussy on his tongue and squirted a nice shot of my cream into his open mouth.Yes, we do love our old van.
