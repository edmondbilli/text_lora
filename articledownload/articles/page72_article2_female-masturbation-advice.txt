As a faithfully unmarried girl, I love reading all the comments between the married folks, but I must admit I wonder if sex will be this great when (and if) I ever get married.I am trying to step up my masturbation and self-exploration so I can really unwrap how my unique body works. I began using my fingers instead of just grinding on a towel and got two fingers into my vagina. It’s very tight, though! I still am not really getting much sensation from the G-spot area and nothing from the clitoris.I did just order my first vibrator, so can’t wait to try it! Any suggestions from those who have more experience?
