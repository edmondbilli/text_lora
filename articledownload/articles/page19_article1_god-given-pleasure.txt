You are loved. God loves you. God, who created you, looks upon you and says, “You are good, indeed, you are very good! You are wonderfully made. Your body is wonderfully made.”God has made your body with many functions and feelings. God loves your body and wants you to enjoy it. God created sex, has designed your body for pleasure, and wants you to feel good!Are you feeling horny? Find a quiet, private, comfortable place to lie down. You might like to put on some relaxing music, light a scented candle, or turn the lights down low. Take your top off so you can access your wonderful skin on your marvelous chest. Keep your underpants on for now. Take some deep breaths. Relax. Be still. Breathe in God’s love for you. Be still and know that you are loved. You are wonderfully made. You are desirable. Smile to yourself as you accept this truth. Breathe in the knowledge that you are desired. Imagine loving yourself as God loves you.God has given you sexual imagination and sexual desires too. How good!Rest one hand gently just above your crotch. Let it linger there. Slowly lick your lips, and with your other hand glide your fingertip sensuously along your lips. God has made your mouth for enjoyment. Imagine being kissed by your lover, your tongues meshing and swirling together with intimacy. Feel the warmth and horniness increase between your legs. You want to touch yourself, but leave your hand resting just above the waistband of your underpants, teasing yourself. It’s ok, you have time. Let the pleasure build.Move your hand from your lips to your chest. Feel the goodness of your fingertips touching your skin. Massage your chest. Circle your nipples with a fingertip. Now pinch them gently between your forefinger and thumb. God is so good to make your chest feel so good.Slowly work your hand under your waistband and rest it on your crotch. Mmm that feels good. Start to stroke yourself with a fingertip, use small circles, up and down the length of your crotch, discovering or rediscovering your favourite pleasure spots. Keep going. Take your time. Breathe. Your crotch should be swelling with enjoyment by now. You might want to slip your underwear off for better access.Squirt some lube on your fingers or use your body’s juices to pleasure yourself even more. Use more of your fingertips, fingers and palms as you go. Keep breathing deeply and go as fast or as slow as you like. This is a time for relaxation, self-care and rejuvenation. Use your imagination. Imagine being with your lover. Imagine it’s their hands pleasuring you, and take the time to enjoy yourself!Thank you, God, for designing sex, creating us for pleasure, for loving us, and helping us love and enjoy ourselves!
