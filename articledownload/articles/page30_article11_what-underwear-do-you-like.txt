I posted a comment about underwearhere.I added this set of recommendedUnderwear Guidelines:1.Must be good to feel yourself through. (Unlined knickers are better then lined ones.)2.Wetness should show up.3.Should be thin enough to be partly see-though. (Sexy and arousing to see the hint of pubic hair.)4.When wet should be more transparent.Recently there were comments about not wearing underwear under a dress. Regular readers will know I prefer to wear underwear, because I like getting them wet, creamy and cummy.It turns me on to allow a view up my skirt/dress of the wet crotch of my knickers. I think wetness shows up better in knickers then on a bare pussy.What are your thoughts about underwear?
