Hi, All.There are some everyday things my wife can do that, in and of themselves, are not sexy, but I sometimes find them arousing. A few examples might be:1. The way she twirls her hair when she talks2. Wearing short shorts and applying lotion to her legs3. Just putting on pantyhose4. Removing her bra without taking off her shirtI can’t be the only one who finds some odd little thing sexy. Do any of you husbands or wives have similar examples?Perhaps even a brief account of how something like this turned into a quickie or steamy sexcapade?Or, do any of you singles have some little quirk that you can’t wait to share with your future spouse?I can’t wait to see your answers!As always, thank you.
