Fellow MHers, we hear that a beloved MH author, HornyGG, is in hospital with Pneumonia and had a reaction to the medication she received. We ask you to add your prayers to ours for her, Ben, and their family. GG has been with MH since pretty much its inception, and her stories have blessed and motivated many of us to grow in marital intimacy and adventure. May our heavenly Father comfort, protect, and heal her, in Jesus name.Your sister in Christ,Missy
