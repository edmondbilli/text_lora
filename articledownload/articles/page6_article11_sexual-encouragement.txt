Hello everyone! We are really grateful for a place like MarriageHeat where believers can share their sexual experiences, desires, stories, and much more.We strongly believe the church has done a horrible job of teaching the goodness and satisfaction of sexuality in marriage! Consequently, believers go and find answers to their curiosity in the wrong places, like porn websites, Hollywood, and many other ungodly places.We just want to encourage you to keep pursuing a passionate sexual life with your spouse and get lost in each other’s bodies and love, because it is a gift from God. Remember, in marriage, everything is allowed if both of you agree to it, from masturbation, the use of sexual toys, oral sex, anal sex, BDSM—again, if you both consent to it—and much more! But never force your spouse to do something they don’t want to do.Blessings and stay HORNY!Does MarriageHeat help you?Yes! It helps me as a husband.Yes! It helps me as a wife.Yes!
