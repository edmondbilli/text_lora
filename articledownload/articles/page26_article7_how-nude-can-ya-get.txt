Hey, everybody. I’ve been a frequent reader of this site on and off for around 4 years, but this is my first time submitting a post. My name’s Jacklyn. I’m in my thirties and I’m currently single right now, but I’m a mother to two beautiful kids. My daughter’s the youngest, she’s 12, and my son recently turned 15.I was curious to compare our household with others. I wouldn’t necessarily say my household is a “nudist” lifestyle. However, I showered naked with my kids up until they were around the age of 6. Both my kids grew up being nude around the house and they both still remain comfortable being nude around me. My son doesn’t stay nude around the house, but once in awhile will come into the next room or kitchen butt-naked in front of me and his younger sister without a care. On a lazy day he’ll usually just have boxerbriefs on. But I don’t find it awkward or uncomfortable seeing my son nude; nudity has always been somewhat familiar to us. I’ve even made jokes to my son that he has a cute butt, and he just looked back at me laughing.I often times just wear a bra and panties around the house, and my daughter has done the same. I personally don’t go nude, even though some of the thong panties I wear make it quite close. And no, I haven’t ever noticed any signs of my kids being weirded out about seeing me wearing just panties. It’s just always been the norm in our household.Look forward to your thoughts!
