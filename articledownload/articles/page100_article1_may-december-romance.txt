Hello, fellow MHers:I’m a man who’s almost 65—but a young 65, a veteran who’s in pretty good shape. I’m widowed for nearly 10 years now.I’m wondering if you can offer me your thoughts, pro versus con, regarding a relationship that I would hope would result in marriage. The woman is 36, so there’s a 29-year age gap. She has two young children who are really great.So what do you think? Is a deepening relationship something I should pursue? Why or why not?
