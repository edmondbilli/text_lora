Hello All,I am long time reader here on MarriageHeat, but have not written a story. Rather, I am curious to know your thoughts on an issue. We are planning to go on a naturist holiday for a week. Has anyone here on MarriageHeat taken a naturist holiday? Is it okay to spend your holidays at naturist resort?I would like your advice, and thank you in advance.
