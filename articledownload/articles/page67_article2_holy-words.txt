When you hear the word “holy,” what images come to your mind? With what things or persons do you associate this word in your thoughts?Holy. Say the word out loud several times and listen to the thoughts in your heart. What emotions does this word invoke in you?If the word “holy” can be defined as “Something or someone set apart, often for a special use or purpose, because of a unique quality inherent in that thing or person” (Do you agree with this definition? How would you define this word?), then it seems to me that we, as re-sired (born again) human beings and followers of Jesus The Christ, should have a sense of, and an understanding of, holiness that extends beyond the thoughts available in the hereditarily impure hearts of those of our fellow human beings who have not yet been re-sired of our God.*With that intro, then, I say, “Welcome MHers to my first post!”I stumbled upon this site as I was searching for a way to showcase the erotic poetry that I write from my marriage bed. (Unfortunately, I cannot post those poems here because the Rules of Engagement stipulate that I will give up my copyrights to anything I post on MarriageHeat. A regrettable, but understandable, contractual thingy which I respect.)Fascinated, though, by the beautiful and holy eroticism I experienced in the explicitness of your story-telling and in the things you shared from your hearts, and after a little prayer, I was inspired to join this community for the freedom of expression available here, as well as for the inspiration you provided my muse, for your sharing the wonder and joy intrinsic to the holy sexuality that you’ve explored in your own marriage beds.Be pleased to know, then, that deciding to join this community is a solemn decision for me because I am a private person who does not subscribe to any social media.Now, to the point. I am, as I know you are, well acquainted with the words we call cuss words. I have used these words all too often when I’m expressing frustration, bitterness, or anger, and, all too often, in the presence of another human being, sometimes even using them to be hurtful. Always after, though, I feel regret as my spirit pricks my conscience which arouses a strongly felt need to apologize, even if it’s just to my God, in order to restore my conscience to quiescence. I have been praying for freedom from this vice and can happily report that I have been making significant progress as my God brings challenges to me (a.k.a. temptations) which reveal to me the untruthful thoughts in my heart, allowing Him to suggest to my spirit better thoughts to replace those thoughts that generate the powerful emotions that lead me to cuss. This is a righteous thing to do, even as Paul pointed out that we should not be using profane and foul language in our speech but that we are to utter only words that are encouraging (Eph 4:29).However, certain ones of those words, have no suitable substitute when it comes to arousing Eros.Consider our words for penis-in-vagina sex: the clinical sounding words-intercourse, copulation, coitus, and coition; the comical words-nookie, shagging, hanky-panky, and canoodling; the neutral phrases-sleep with, lie with, to know, and take to bed; and the profane sounding words-screwing, frigging, boffing, and bonking—and pages more.Notice that none of these words come close to the power of the English word “fucking” to express the erotic feelings we generate when, well… when we are fucking.Unfortunately, because we are all born profane beings, we English-speaking humans all too easily hijack the power in that word to our own detriment in the hearing of others as we blasphemously turn it from a happy verb into an angry adjective.You know of what I speak.So, what do you think might happen in your thoughts, and thus to your emotional reaction to hearing that word, if you embraced the idea that this word was holy, that is, set apart for a special use or purpose, because of a unique quality inherent in that word, specifically the power to arouse when used from one spouse to another to spur on more intense action when in the heat of passion?Of course, that’s not the only word from that list that we, as Believers, could consider holy. Our words for our genitalia could also be considered holy no matter how euphemistic or explicit the words a couple may choose, between themselves, to describe them are.Is this something you’ve ever thought of before? I would like to hear what you have to say.And now, as I will say often to you in closing as an encouragement to you and as a reminder of the righteousness we are called to be trained in, “Keep being good, MHers! It is, after all, what you were created to be!”Eleutheros* I hope to be posting more on this concept later, God and Marriage Heat willing. In the meantime, check out this scripture, I John 3:3-9 and remember that John, The Beloved Disciple, was the only disciple present when Jesus spoke with Nicodemus in private.
