Many authors mention nipple play in their stories, so I have a few questions for them and the other women on MH. (Husbands, you might invite your wives to comment on your account if they don’t have one of their own. Maybe they’d like to join the conversation.)It seems some, such as CreamyPatty, prefer pretty fierce nipple play: lots of pulling, pinching, and twisting. Would it be fair to say that some pain is involved as well? If that’s your preference, have you always preferred rough treatment of your nipples, even when younger? When you masturbate, do you “man-handle” them as well? Is your erotic focus solely on your nipples, or do you like your tits handled roughly as well with lots of grabbing and squeezing? Do you like for your husband to suck your tits, too, or is your preference more the pulling and pinching and twisting your nipples? And does such regular pulling and twisting change your nipples at all, making them change shape or size?  For those of you who cum from nipple play, does it have to be the same kind every time (in Patty’s case, the hard pulling and pinching) or does any type of nipple play do it for you?  I’ve even read that some women orgasm while breast feeding. Wouldn’t that make frequent breastfeeding something to look forward to even more! LOLLadies, chime in on the kinds of tit and nipple play you love most and get off on. It’ll give our husbands ideas of things to try for us and for us to try ourselves. I know some women can even suck their own nipples while masturbating. Nice!
