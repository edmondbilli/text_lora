(L) – This post contains strong language.Hey MH family!This is not a story, but more of a question. I was recently asked out on a date by this man who attends the same church as I do.Here is my dilemma:1) It hasn’t been that long since Ben passed away. And I told the gentleman this and he seemed to understand. Plus Ben was the love of my life and going on a date with another man would seem strange to say the least. Plus I have told myself that I would never do it.However my daughter Alicia and my son-in-law think that I should start dating again. And I gotta admit the thought has been weighing on my mind, and I have prayed about it. Is it too soon?2) The gentleman (whom I will call “Jeff”) is five years younger than myself. He is sweet, handsome and a very devoted Christian from what I can tell. He kinda reminds me of Ben as he looks athletic with a tall and trim physique. He just has light brown hair. I honestly don’t understand why he would want to ask a old woman like myself out! Lol.Lord knows that I don’t want people to think I’m insensitive to Ben’s memory, believe me I’m not. And Lord be, I don’t want to be labeled as a “cougar” either. I mean it’s not like if I decided to go out with him that I would let him screw me.My friend Gail said I should go for it and that I shouldn’t worry about what others think. And that even if I did fuck him it would be nobody’s business.Gail’s right about not caring what others think. But deep down it would bother me. As far as the other, well God would know and that would really bother me.Part of me kinda wants to. The other part of me is… let’s just say conflicted. I have been praying about it, as I know God will put in my heart what I should do.So what do you think, my MH family? I honestly trust your opinion. Should I say yes, or should I say no and wait?Thanks!GG
