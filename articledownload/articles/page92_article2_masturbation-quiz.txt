Over the last several years of being a part of MarriageHeat, my wife and I have enjoyed many of the posts here. We love the epic, steamy stories that so many of you write. Some of them have really encouraged us to be more adventurous in our own sex life as a young, Christian married couple. Additionally, we like reading along with the commentary on the discussion posts—many of the discussions turn out to be as hot as the sex stories, which brings me to this post.We thought it might be fun to hear about some of your solo habits! Julie and I enjoy masturbation, together as well as on our own. We’ve made solo play a part of our lives in addition to sex since the beginning of our marriage. So, here are some questions that we think might be fun to answer as well as provide helpful suggestions to others in this anonymous, sex-positive group of believers:Gender?Age?How often do you masturbate? Has this changed throughout your life?How many times have you ever orgasmed in one day?For ladies: do you prefer clit stimulation, vaginal penetration, and/or anal stimulation?For men: do you incorporate anal/prostate or testicle play in your sessions?Do you ever enjoy tasting your own juices?Can you have multiple orgasms during a single session?Do you prefer masturbating by yourself or with your spouse?Do you use toys? If so, which are your favorites?Do you have a go-to position for solo play?Where was the riskiest place you ever tried pleasuring yourself?What new ways of jacking/jilling off do you want to try?Looking forward to your responses!
