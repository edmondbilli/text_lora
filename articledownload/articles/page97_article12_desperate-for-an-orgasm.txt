My wonderful husband, who’s 32, and I, 27, have been married for four years. We waited to have sex until we were married. Having worked together for five years, four of those as a married couple, we have quickly sped through the newlywed phase with the exception of1. our new life of living together once we were married, and2. our leveled-up intimacy in finally being able to become one.It’s not that my husband isn’t a wonderful lover! I just feel bad for never being in the mood, never having had an orgasm, and lacking excitement or anticipation for sex. (Too Much Information coming your way: I feel all the good things. I’m just scared of actually urinating on my spouse/bed. I have done my research and feel like I have tried everything.)One of the things I am struggling with in all of this is comparing my marriage and sex life to others. Hearing that my Christian friends having orgasms and/or sex every night, etc. just makes me feel like I’m being punished. (It’s more confusing when they did not follow God’s design of sex being in marriage yet are blessed in that realm.)I have prayed and invited God into our marriage bed, had conversations about sex, and done everything I can to help us grow in this part of our marriage. And I still feel as though there has been no progress.Any and all advice is appreciated!! Thank you in advance!!Disclaimers: I’m off my birth control to increase my libido. We do not have children. Everything is fair game except anal. We are so in love with each other as friends. I know we are faithful to God and each other. I have never been able to masturbate to orgasm. and we have been to marriage counseling but not regarding this topic.
