I’m new here and was just curious to ask a question: how many others out there find their spouse to be extremely attractive being hairy and natural? (Especially regarding the genital area.)Me and my wife have been married for almost 10 years, and ever since I have known her, she has always kept well-groomed. She will occasionally trim, and sometimes shave her bikini area during summer months. The most she has shaved is her labia, which looks sexy, especially leaving the patch on top.She thinks I’m crazy for this. For some reason, I have an extreme obsession with her having it all hairy. I’m cool even with her never trimming it on the regular. I really love going down on my wife, especially when she hasn’t trimmed. She has the most intoxicating scent from her pheromones that is hypnotizing. I almost prefer to give her oral after we been out for the day or night. Her scent gets trapped in her pubic hair and I just can’t get enough.
