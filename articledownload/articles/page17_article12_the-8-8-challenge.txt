Do you really know what your spouse likes in bed? How far are you willing to go to satisfy them? Below is a challenge that my husband and I tried which led to some of our best sex. It is intended to help communicate what each person likes when the other is performing oral on them.The challenge:The wife will start out by sitting on the husbandâ€™s face while he performs oral on her for 8 minutes. His goal is to get her to cum within 8 minutes. If she cums, then she will perform oral sex on him while he instructs her on exactly how to suck his cock. If she does not cum, she will move down and begin riding his cock.Once she begins riding his cock, the timer is reset to 8 minutes and her goal is to make him cum. If he cums, she will climb back up on his face, where she will instruct him on exactly how to perform oral on her again. If he does not cum while she rides him, both can go about sex as usual, or choose from either or both of the other scenarios if they wish.Note: you can change the length of time as you see fit.My husband was hesitant at first, but the thought of him cleaning up his mess and following my instructions on how to lick and suck my clitoris gave me the most mind blowing orgasm to date. Knowing now how much this turns me on, he willingly offers to have me sit on his face if I do not cum before he does.
