Hi, all. I’m new here, and 24 years old.I’ve read a few stories here, and most of them are amazing. Especially on how important sex is for a married couple and what it represents. There have been many categories which I’ve read, and of course I understand why we do “it”. However, getting straight to the point, and this is a question for the ladies …What is the most important reason why you’d like to go down on your man and give him blowjobs? What prompts you to do it?Thanks in advance for your insight.
