Dear MHers,On this day of gratitude in the U.S., Calvin and I are so thankful for the opportunity to help build and support a culture of hot, Biblical monogamy—and for all of you who support this mission with your readership, writing, and financial assistance. May God bless your marriages, whether they exist or are yet to be, and you for your obedience to Him. You keep the marriage bed holy and hold marriage in high honor, as is fitting for a relationship that exemplifies Christ’s with his Church. Thank you!Love in Christ,Missy
