(L) – This post contains strong language.URGENT requests.Years before finding MarriageHeat, I had longed for a site like this: a place with believing Christians who are also “hot-wired” for sex, fellowshipping at various levels, free to express themselves and their heartfelt emotions and desires.  This is part of the “wholeness” that Jesus promised, as opposed to the mechanical approach found on porn sites.  Obviously, no one can heal sexual wounds better than the God that designed and created us, including our sexual aspects.With that foundation, I have two prayer requests.  Details later.  For now, the foundation.Some of you may recall from my introductory posting a few weeks ago that I have been divorced twice.  My first wife, although shapely and attractive, often withheld sex as a weapon.  Our marriage became a slow-moving train wreck.  The process of the divorce was even worse.  (I’ll spare you those details.)My second wife was more sexually willing, but later developed health problems that eventually destroyed her sex drive altogether.  I had not been laid in more than 10 years when she divorced me for looking at porn to get some relief.  It has now been four more years since I have enjoyed “the comfort of a woman.”As if the above were not bad enough, in 2006 I had emergency abdominal surgery.  (The details are kinda icky…)  Over the next two or three years following the surgery, scar tissue developed inside my lower abdomen.  Apparently, that scar tissue has choked off something in my “plumbing” to the point that I can no longer ejaculate.  It has been 10 or 12yearssince I have shot a full load of cum.  (On rare occasions, a few drops will make their way out, sometimes painfully.)The above is a far cry from my previous performance, even into my fifties.  (I’m now 66. Thanks for asking…  😉  ) Sure, I’d be glad to provide a couple of examples.When we were still dating, my first wife and I finally decided to have “real” sex.  (We had experimented with various forms of “almost” sex during three years of a long-distance engagement while I was in the military.)  When we went further, we both knew that it was a sin, but we couldn’t resist any longer.  Without glorifying the details, I found out that I could cum very powerfully and shoot a long distance with some significant force behind it!On another occasion, maybe 10 years into our marriage, we were fucking doggy-style.  She was kneeling on the edge of the bed, and I stood behind her with a great view of her big, meaty, beautiful, pear-shaped ass.  I told her that I was getting ready to cum, and she said, “Cum on my ass!”  She rarely talked quite like that, and so I knew that she wasreallyturned on that day.  Her command caught me by pleasant surprise and turned me on even further, which resulted in a big load building up.  Although Iaimedfor her magnificent ass, the load flew waaaaaaaaaaay farther—and got stuck in her hair.  (As I type this, my balls are starting to ache with the thought of someday being able to do that again…)With those two examples in mind, you can understand the double-whammy problem of both the emotional and the mechanical frustrations of my situation.  Iwantto shoot my cum, and Ineedto shoot my cum, but I can’t.  Worse yet, the problem has increased to the point that, in recent years, my orgasms are accompanied by an increasing amount ofpain.I’m not a doctor, but I have had some emergency medical training.  (And, sadly, as a result of my military injuries, I have spent plenty of time listening to medical jargon during various hospital stays.)  My educated guess is that I have developed some sort of spinal neuropathy—most likely a combination of the scar tissue from the intestinal surgery, the degeneration of my spinal discs (aftermath of a high-speed parachute malfunction), and weight gain from “mood food” caused by lack of sex.  Doctors brush off my concerns, saying, “Oh…  ‘retrograde ejaculation’ is common in men your age.  It won’t cause cancer or anything.”  (I have done enough reading online to know that “retrograde ejaculation” isnotwhat I have.  The pain originates in my lumbar spine.)Now, as if all of that were not bad enough…  Even if I were able to have normal orgasms, I have no one to have themwith.Even during my teenage years, my sex drive was higher than most of my friends.  Now, at age 66, that is still true.  And, even mypastorkinda laughed-off my request for a prayer that I find a woman that could keep up with my sex drive.Were it not for this MH site, I would not have found a group of believing Christians that can not only allow me the freedom to express these concerns, but also pray for them.  So, I ask my brothers and sisters in Christ to pray that God will:Heal my insides and restore my physical sexual health, andGrant me a believing Christian wife that has a matching sex drive.Sadly, most churches seem to consider these topics off-limits.  But, I know that God cares for me—allof me.  I have prayed about these things many times over the years.  But now, here, I can access agroupof fellow believers that can lift these concerns up to God.Thank you in advance for your prayers.PS:  There is no category to click for “prayer requests”, and so I’m using the next-closest thing.
