First of all MHers, I want to give you an update on my wife, Melody.  I am a volunteer editor so I can add things to a post or edit it at the last minute, before publication.  So I wanted to let y’all know that Melody’s back surgery led to some major health problems.  It has been a rough week. We want you to know that we are grateful for your prayers.  Melody is home now and recovering. We felt the power of your prayers. Thank you!One more note.  Melody is, of course, not my wife’s real name.  But she was nearly named that.  She told me the other day that she has decided that she prefers her pseudonym to be spelled “Melody.”  That will take some getting used to for me.  But this post will have the new spelling.Somehow, I’ve been hesitant to submit the story of Melody’s and my first full lovemaking session. But my 90th post on MH seemed a good time to tell it—at least, sort of. I am now working on writing up the full story, but here it is in a poem. It is in my wife Melody’s voice, and although I wrote it, it is based on our experience on our honeymoon. My beautiful, kind, and sexy Melody really liked this poem when I read it to her this morning. She felt that I should share the poem with our MarriageHeat friends. The poem is about her gifting me her virginity on our honeymoon.  I hope y’all will give this poem a chance. It is based 100% on fact.“Melody First Time”I call my husband’s handsome dick “Fred”I love how he pleases me in bedHe’s a beautiful dickThat really does the trickAnd he keeps me sexually fedBut at first,I was wary of FredAs I lay upon my virgin bedWhen I saw him at firstHe looked like he might burst“I came, I saw, I conquered!” I saidMy Tommy was so gentle and kindHis caresses soothed me – body and mindHe sucked on my nipsWith his talented lipsAnd I returned the favor in kindWe could not get Fred in on our wedding nightIt was quite an interesting plightBut I made Fred cum twiceDoing things that felt niceThe  next morning,things worked out all right“It’s hard ‘cause you saved yourself for me,”Said my new husband whom I did not want to flee“I love you, my dear.”He whispered in my ear“Your lock will be opened by my key!”So, I woke my Tom early at fiveI had never, ever felt more alive“Let’s DO this!” I saidAs I lay nude on the bedSoon into my pussy Fred would diveFred has a very nice tapered tipIn my virgin pussy, he nicely fitWhen he reached my hymenI thought I would die, manAs my cherry he carefully ripped“Owee!
