This is for the ladies of MH!A lot of you talk about sexy episodes with your man where you don’t wear any underwear.  I love the idea and intend doing it if I ever get married. But I’m curious: what about when your vagina is leaking cervical mucus? (Obviously going panty-less isn’t viable during menstruation).For quite a few days each cycle, a woman secretes mucus.  How do you keep from getting those fluids on stuff when you’re commando? Sometimes before ovulation my underwear is soaked or gooey.  It will even hang out in long, stringy, egg-white-like drips that need to be wiped up when I use the bathroom.I’ve never NOT worn underwear and can’t imagine doing so while I’m around my family members.I’d love to hear what you ladies do.  Thanks!
