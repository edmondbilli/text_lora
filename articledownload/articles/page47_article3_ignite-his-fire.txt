A talk: Just for the LADIES.These “Naughty but Nice” ideas can be of great value to get your thoughts going and hopefully it will give you the start to a more exciting love-life.Prov 5:15Be faithful to your own wife andgive your love to her alone.Songs of Solomon 5:4-5My beloved extended his hand through the opening, And my feelings were aroused for him. I arose to open to my beloved; And my hands dripped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the bolt.  (Sounds like masturbation to me)SOME WAYS TO KEEP THE FIRE LIT –Think SEXY!Here are some‘naughty’ideas that you can use.  (Not all are our own) Think up your own ‘games’ and write them down.  More than half the fun is in the planning.Write a note to your husband entitled: “10 placesyour hands could beother than this book!” Make your list as naughty as you want! Then slip the note into his favorite book, paper or magazine.I took an empty bottle and gave it a label“Romance Medicine-Take as needed.”Then I wrote out 50 or so love notes and sexy ideas that could be taken anytime a cure was needed. I placed it inside the bottle and gave the bottle to my hubby as a gift.The arrest:I arrived at his job and placed a large poster sized note on the windshield of his car that read, “Detective — (my name) is on your trail, and she always gets her man.” Then I left a small gift bag with handcuffs and a note that read, “This is all you will be wearing when I get my hands on you.” When he returned home, I had a poster-sized note hanging in the living room that read, “Come into the bedroom with your hands up.” When he entered the room, I was sitting in the chair with a blazer on, lingerie underneath (that he could not see) and a hat that looked like the one that detectives used to wear. The theme song from the show “COPS” was playing (I previously recorded it). I performed my own strip search on him. And the rest was a “wrap!”Lipstick kisses:My husband and I spent all night making love and I had to get up earlier than him to go to work. I put on my sexiest shade of lipstick and kissed his bathroom mirror a couple of times and left a message telling him how much fun I had. He said it made him smile all day long.Bathroom bliss:Do you know what time he is planning on coming home? Show up at the door in a robe with a response of “It’s not 5:30 already? I’m not ready yet.” Seem a bit flustered and head into the bathroom to “finish getting ready.” Call him into the bathroom a couple minutes later to help you with a zipper or something. When he arrives, have a bubble bath ready with candles lit and all. Let him strip and get in to relax. Close the curtain on the bath. Remove his clothes and leave a small box containing a pair of silk boxers and a robe. While he relaxes go start on dinner. Either eat first, or second. Either way should be fine 🙂 Enjoy!Those flying panties:My dear sweet husband was flying out of town on a business trip for a few days. I was going to miss him so much, so I wrote a love note explaining to him that I would miss him very much and that I will be waiting for him, without my panties. I included my panties along with the letter! As an option I wrote “You can put them on me or not…” He still carries my panties with him in his briefcase! Oh, how I Love that man!!!Songs of Solomon 1:12-16My king was lying on his couch, and my perfume filled the air with fragrance. My lover has the scent of myrrh as he lies upon my breasts. How beautiful you are, my love; how your eyes shine with love! How handsome you are, my dearest; how you delight me!  (Your man really needs to hear some compliments from you.)Going blind:As your husband walks into the door one day, tell him you have a surprise for him. Lead him into the bedroom where you lit up some candles earlier and blindfold him. Then begin undressing him, slowly kissing every inch of his body, the blindfold ads that extra excitement and a little spice into the evening.Cover yourself with whipped creamand take a picture of yourself in the house. Sneak the pictures into his briefcase before he leaves for work. Tape a note that says, “Dessert anyone!?” Or e-mail it to him with the same note.  Watch the sparks fly!!Next time youtake a bathwith your husband, wear satin/silk lingerie. Just step right into the water with it on. You can well imagine what he will see when it gets wet! Very erotic and sexy!You and your matewrite down your most erotic fantasieson slips of paper and put them in 2 small bottles. Take turns each weekend and draw one out ofthe other one’s bottle. Then try and fulfil their fantasy for them. This is a great way of keeping the flame always burning in your relationship.GREAT!!Send him on anold-fashioned love-huntwith very sexy and naughty cryptic notes at every station. His prize:  You are waiting –BE CREATIVE!!!Give him a manicure.Have everything ready: Clear polish, clippers, soapy water and lotion for his hands.  Tel him how strong and powerful his hands are.  How you love them to touch you, while you massage them.  Be wild and sexy in your explanation.  You might want to tell him what he can do with those hands once you have finished.Forget your underwear. Just before you enter a meeting, or restaurant or a friend’s house, lean over and in a low voice tell him you forgot to put on your panties. (This might be the most exciting thing for many men.)  The rest of the meeting will be very difficult for him to concentrate.Say it with sticky notes:Leave him notes in unexpected places. Like the inside of the toilet seat saying:  Take care of my favorite part of your body!Songs of Solomon 2:3Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the young men. In his shade I took great delight and sat down, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.  (I think this text is talking about a Blow-Job)Give him a call:Call him at his place of work and tell him how much you love him and what you intend to do to him tonight when he gets home.  Be outrageous!!!   He will be busy with what you said the entire day and will not be able to get home soon enough!Give him a massage.Buy a book or look up on the internet about basic ways of massage.  Get a good oil and massage him for at least an hour. In a low voice tell him he is sexy; he is your one and only true love.  What you want to do to him.  Be outrageous.  When he wants to get up and start the action say no, I am not done.  Make him wait.  THEN…..Furry seduction:I have also “gone out” with the girls. Well, he thought so.  Just to return later withonly a fur coat on.  I will knock and when he opens, the coat will fall open and I will say something sexy like: “Just what the doctor ordered sir, I am here to serve.” Or you might try, “Have you ever eaten a furry animal? Would you like to try?”Songs of Solomon 4:16Awake, O north wind, And come, wind of the south; Make my garden breathe out fragrance, Let its spices be wafted abroad. May my beloved come into his garden And eat its choice fruits!”  (What does this sound like to you?)Cookies for sale:Now I (asMaxxthe husband) want to tell you of the most memorable day in my life. — My wife told me that she had an appointment to have Coffee with her best friend. About 20 minutes after she left there was a knock at my door.  When I opened the door there was a girl in a very short and revealing school dress and she was selling cookies. The dress was miles too short and the top could not cover her breasts.She asked me if my wife was at home.  When I said “NO” she asked if I would like to buy some of her cookies.  She made it very clear that she was desperate to sell her cookies and she would do anything for me if I would buy all her cookies.  I invited her in (what else could I do?) and the rest was an evening of the sweetest lovemaking (with my wifedressed in her old school uniform) that I have ever had.   Oh, before I forget… I bought ALL her cookies and invited her to bring more.   Now I am waiting for the knock at my door!Action assignment:On a regular basis, find creative ways to show your husband how much you want to have a love affair with him.Never postpone happiness.Being a good lover goes far beyond paying your husband compliments and wearing a sexy nightgown.  It also means taking responsibility for your own happiness.If you are a member of the“If only”Club, you are robbing yourself of the only thing we can really do something about – The‘Here and Now.’Do not wait for tomorrow, start now.  Make a difference in your life today it is your responsibility to be happy.  Be open and confront your husband when something is not right.  Many women don’t confront their husbands because they are afraid of driving them away.  They believe that peace and harmony are insurance against abandonment. It is quite the opposite.   A woman who values herself and her needs gains the respect of her husband.Respect yourself.  If you do not respect yourself, chances are no one else will respect you either.  Self respect comes from being true to yourself, from feeling good about who you are.  It comes from letting other people know how you truly feel.  So be true to yourself, confront the people that hurt you, and complete your unfinished business.Don’t sendmixed messages.  (Men are not good guessers.)Be open and honest about what you want.  Tell thetruth.Make a wish list.Get your husband to make one too and discuss it.Be playful.Use pet names, or baby talk, or play games to release the children inside you.Think Sexy:For this to work… YOU have toThink SEXY!Never stop thinking of ways to make your life together as playful and sexy as possible.  Think about ways of making any situation into a sexy happening.May God bless you as you pour yourself into making your marriage a delight to you and your husband, and something that your friends would desire.
