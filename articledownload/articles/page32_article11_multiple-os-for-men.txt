There is a lot of talk about women having multiple orgasms, and I love it. Making your gal cum over and again is a beautiful thing. Thereâ€™s less talk about men having more than one orgasm, though, and Iâ€™d like to address it.Not to brag, but I have a lot of experience with masturbation. (Thatâ€™s a joke btw. Itâ€™s funny because itâ€™s true. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰) In my masturbatory explorations, Iâ€™ve learned to cum more than once. The honest truth is, I can cum more than a few times.Granted, Iâ€™m not rock hard as the orgasms progress, but the intensity doesnâ€™t really diminish. In fact, if Iâ€™m really turned on, just the opposite is true.Iâ€™ve learned that if I slow down or stop for just the right amount of time after I ejaculate, then start again, it will build into another orgasm. This process can go on for several minutes.It took time and practice, but my record is 15. Yes, 15. I realize there may be naysayers that balk at this number, but itâ€™s true. Now, that doesnâ€™t happen every time, but five or six is pretty common.Why do I bring this up? Two reasons.1. Are there other guys out there who have similar experiences?2. I want to encourage guys to the fact that you donâ€™t have to be one and done.In addition, these multiple O experiences can move into the sex life you have with your wife, and can be freaking intense.It could also be a sexy challenge for your wife. Just how many times can she make you cum?As always, singles feel free to join the conversation.Iâ€™d love to hear your questions or comments. â€“ KM
