A poem to my future husbandSometimes, love makes me silent;It causes tenderest feelings to arise,My soul overflowing, my heart in my eyes.I’m content to gaze at you,Reading our romance like a wonderful book.Ah, this is when love is a speaking look.Whenever you’re late, I’m waiting;To be in your arms is my great desire,The love springing up deep inside like a fire.Your smile…it warms me anew;I love to see it when the winter days are long;This is when love is a silent song.My happiest moments are by your side,And nothing else so satisfies.You melt my inward being with the love in your eyes.Our fibers, being entwined,Feel stretched when we’re parted much;This is when love is an unfelt touch.The goal of my life, next to loving God,Is to cherish you more as the days go on.Every evening we end should but bring new, tender dawn!May never my love grow cold, grow dim!Whatever life brings, I will be your help meet;This is when love is an invisible fragrance sweet.My soul delights in your tender strength;You know when to forward press,Yet your rugged hands can softly caress.To follow you, to stand in your shadow,To feel safe, to have you face the world for me…Ah, this is what love, in the dark, can see.I thank God for giving me to you,That in His mercy and foresight above,He granted me the bliss, the joy of your love.When I’m with you, heedless of all else,I know that somehow, we portrayHow love is when it’s in God’s holy way.
