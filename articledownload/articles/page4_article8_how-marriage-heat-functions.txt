MarriageHeat is a labor of love. I am so grateful for the people who make this website possible.Recently, I realized that I couldn’t log into my account. I wanted to encourage a couple on here, but could not log in. Then, the next day, I found out the operator was trying to remedy my situation. I sent a message and found out she was working on helping me—on her one day off!Friends of MH, we are very fortunate to have such loving and committed Christians leading this site.Thank you so much!LH
