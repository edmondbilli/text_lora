Hi, brothers and sisters.I’m a 29 years old virgin man. As I have never had a real sexual adventure with any one, I’m curious about how long a man can keep an erection before cumming. Actually, I’m a little unsure if I could satisfy a woman in bed.I am currently…studyingsome lovemaking techniques by reading books and watching someeducationalvideos. I know that women hardly ever hit an orgasm with just penetration and need a lot of foreplay to get there, which includes oral stimulation and masturbation. But I’ve also learned that a heterosexual woman loves receiving pleasure by feeling her man’s penis going back and forth inside her and the friction of his body against her clitoris while they passionately make love. Since a woman takes time to get achieve orgasm, the longer a man can keep an erection the better. My concern is that I don’t know if I am able to stay hard long enough to please my future wife.I have kept my penis hard for 45 minutes before cumming one night. I could’ve made it longer, maybe 15 minutes more, but I didn’t want to push my limits. This was the only time I tried to make it this long.Is this normal, or am I doing something great? Of course, I was alone, and I’m sure it is way harder not to cum when one is face-to-face with a beautiful woman.How long can a man keep an erection without any medicine? I know there are drugs for this, but I am not going to risk my health.I am not sure if I could be good in bed with a woman, and I’m very insecure about it.
