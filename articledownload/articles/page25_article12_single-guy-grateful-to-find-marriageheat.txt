For context, I’m a single, 28-year-old guy from Canada who came across this site out of a need for answers.As a single guy with a high sex drive waiting for marriage, I’m thankful to have come across this site.While I was recently getting out of a 12-year-long porn addiction (which I’m thankful to Christ alone for getting me out of), I still not only had a strong sex drive, but also felt envious and angry at seeing examples of non-Christians who seem to be having incredible sex lives.Why are people actively taking part in adultery and being with numerous partners seem to be thriving in life and having such fulfilling sex lives while I’m doing my best to follow God yet haven’t found a connection with another woman yet?It made me angry, it made me frustrated, but it also made me desperate for answers. I started finding answers in the rewards of waiting for marriage and having marital sex as the Bible commands. I also saw the consequences of following a lifestyle thatlookshot and fulfilling on the surface, but according to the Bible, it instead leads people into depraved and sinful lives.That’s when I found a story on this site about a couple who had overcome a swinging situation. They nearly gave in to that lifestyle, but came out better after seeking to fulfill their sexuality with each other and in a Biblical way.Then I came across other stories on this site of people who were indeed having ridiculously fulfilling sex lives with their spouses (trust me, I’m not using these stories as “material”; just inspiration).It honestly made me feel relieved and inspired as a Christian waiting for marriage. I really needed that assurance that God’s plan for sexuality was the right way to go, even if it would take me longer to have that desire come to full fruition through marriage.In addition, I was able to see the lies of pornography and the hedonistic lifestyles they promote for what they really were: lifestyles that destroyed the beauty and fulfillment that comes through truly being connected with another person, instead choosing in favour of shallow and self-destructive sex lives that bring out the worst in ourselves and in others.The church doesn’t often like to talk about sex, or how much of an influence it has. But with how many people nowadays view pornography, read erotic novels, or simply live out non-Biblical sex lives, I think it’s incredibly important to attain a proper and healthy Biblical view of sex. Otherwise, it becomes too easy at one point to believe the lie of Satan: that Biblical sex is unfulfilling, and the only fulfillment one could get from sex is to do the exact opposite of what the Bible says.It also made me realize that as a man, I would have to fight for my future marriage—to ensure that my wife continues to belong to me, and for me to belong to my wife. It wouldn’t be a passive expectation that remains in the background, because that would allow room for extramarital desires and affairs to take root in both of us.But also, most importantly, these revelations helped me with my relationship with Christ, because it made me realize that He really does want what’s best for me. Also, I found encouragement to continue working hard on myself so that I could have a fulfilling monogamous relationship one day like the people on this site do.So for the founder of this site, and the people on here, I want to thank you as a single Christian guy who’s still in the process of working towards a fulfilling marital relationship one day. You’ve all been a great encouragement and help to me, and stopped me from believing the lies of porn and non-Biblical sex lives.
