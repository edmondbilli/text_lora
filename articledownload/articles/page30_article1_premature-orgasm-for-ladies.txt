Hello all, I come to you with a question.As a single woman waiting for marriage, I masturbate frequently. During many of these sessions I tend to start by using multiple fingers to stroke my vulva over my panties. This usually gets me going, but sometimes I also rub and squeeze my breasts with one hand while the other reaches into my panties to touch my bare and usually shaven pussy lips. However… once it starts to feel good, it gets good quickly. My orgasm builds quickly, and if I am not careful and don’t stop rubbing my clit in time, I orgasm way sooner than intended.I can come multiple times in one session, but it does get very sensitive in between. Though sometimes if I keep going through the orgasm, I will quickly experience another orgasm which is usually a bit milder than the first. It is so hard to stop myself from cumming sometimes, even though edging myself for a while will give me a bigger, more intense orgasm.It’s hard to stop when the pleasure begins to peak, and once my hips start to buck I know I’ve reached the point of no return. Sometimes if I don’t stop rubbing in time to prevent an orgasm, I end up orgasming anyway!Speaking of which, I get particularly hot when reading some masturbation stories on MH, and some of the comments. I love hearing people talk about how a story turned them on, or maybe even prompted some self or partner play.I cannot wait to feel a man’s hard rod, and I fantasize about bouncing up and down as my little pussy continues to pulse and is wet from pleasure. After drafting this story, I couldn’t help myself and my mind began to wander as my fingers played with my womanhood. I can already feel myself getting closer and know it’s going to be hard to stop in time if I don’t slow down.Do any other ladies have this issue? How do you edge yourself easier? How can I last longer when masturbating?
