The church service having ended, people begin milling around. Young parents rush to pick up their toddlers from child care. Perhaps some are hurrying off to lunch, others hoping to the catch the attention of a dear friend they haven’t see over the summer. I keep my eyes down at first, careful to not trip over the small children that are scampering about, weaving left and right through the “big people” obstacles. Then my eyes come up to navigate through the ever-changing maze of exiting worshippers.Off to the right I notice a friend I haven’t seen for several weeks. I greet him with a cheery “Good morning. How are you,” and keep moving through the crowd.I turn my head back to look straight ahead. As a tall man passes by on my left, a forty something woman comes into view. She is quite attractive – I like her hairstyle, she has a nice smile, and a trim, fit body.In the second or two it takes for us to pass each other, my eyes focused on her chest. Her breasts were perfectly sized. Perfectly shaped. Perfectly displayed—probably more revealingly than some would consider appropriate for church.She and they came and went in the blink of an eye. The beginnings of an erection came and went as fast as the cause vanished from my view.A question prodded at my mind: Did lust exist in that moment? Simply because the brain popped out the word “perfect?” Or queried, “perfect for what?”I thought of a friend of mine who would feel extremely awkward at such a situation. He would instantly try to erase the memory from his mind, then look for a trusted female friend to tell the woman to cover up. Really. I’m not exaggerating. If he knew I was thinking, “Wow, nice breasts,” I’m pretty sure he would sit me down and pronounce judgement.On to the discussion question: What do you think is an appropriate way to act in a situation like this, and why? How do you feel about the two different reactions in the scene (mine and my friend’s)?
