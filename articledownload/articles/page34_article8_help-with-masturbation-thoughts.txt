How should a Christian wife who wants to practice hot monogamy deal with sexual thoughts of sex outside of marriage as she masturbates?LittleBlueBird asks this question.Hello, I’m not a new reader to this site, but this is my first time posting. I’m looking for some advice. I’m a Christian, married woman who grew up in a not-so-Christian atmosphere, and I still have a hard time kicking some of the sexual desires that don’t go with godly sexuality. It’s only an issue when I masturbate (my husband and I have a very engaging sex life, no issues there), but when I do, I have such a hard time NOT thinking about or reading about (or sometimes even watching when I’m really weak) sexual things that fall outside the line of what God designed it for. I do have some kinks I feel are acceptable within the Godly view of sex and marriage, but sometimes they seem dull to me, and I keep falling back to sinful fantasies and desires.Does anyone here have advice on this? Anything to help me keep this within the lines of what is acceptable as a Christian? Is there a point at which a person should just stop masturbating altogether?How should a Christian wife who wants to practice hot monogamy deal with sexual thoughts of sex outside of marriage as she masturbates?PollHow should a Christian wife who wants to practice hot monogamy deal with sexual thoughts of sex outside of marriage as she masturbates?
