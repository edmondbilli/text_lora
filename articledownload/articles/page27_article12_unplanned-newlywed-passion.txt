(L) – This story contains strong language.This is my first MH post, so I hope you enjoy this story of the first time my wife and I were sexually intimate. Please excuse punctuation errors and misspellings (dyslexia is the worst haha). [Editor’s note: No worries, that’s what we’re here for! 🙂 ]Anyway enjoy!To give a little context my wife (T) and I (J) have known each other since we were in middle school (around 12–13 years old) but didn’t start dating until senior year of high-school. Both my wife and I were both raised as active members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints (aka Mormons, LDS) and are still happily active members to this day. As such, we were both virgins at our wedding. We strived very hard throughout our pre-marriage relationship to stay pure for each other.I’m not saying we didn’t kiss, because we definitely made out every chance we could! We occasionally had to take a step back before our young lust drove us over the edge, and we crossed the line we and God had set for us. But we got very close to that line—probably too close, but without ever crossing said line. But that’s a story for another time.Staying on the right side of that line was obviously difficult because we were both very sexually attracted to each other, and the absolute best of friends, so it was very easy to get overly comfortable with each other. For me, it was very difficult because T is absolutely gorgeous!T is 5’4″ with a very fit frame from competitive dancing her entire life, but she is also lustfully curvy with 34DDD breasts and a nice, firm ass that turns any man into an absolute flagpole, if you know what I mean! Though she hates it, I love her perfect, ivory skin, and its contrast to her brown, almost auburn hair. She is the vision of perfection.But the sexiest things about T are her smile and her laugh. Filling her with joy and hearing her infectious laugh makes me so hard I can’t hardly stand straight when wearing pants for risk of breaking straight through the fabric.I don’t want to toot my own horn or come across as full of myself but, I’m no slouch myself, being 5’9 with a very muscular, fit, V-shaped build from cross country running (didn’t skip leg day), wrestling, and years of intense physical training. I have dark, raven-colored hair and very bronze, tanned skin from my outdoor hobbies and years of lifeguarding from when I was younger. When it comes to the department below the belt, I’m above average.After high school, T and I continued to date steadily until I left on a two-year voluntary Mission in 2011-2013. When I had a little over a month left, T also decided to serve a mission herself. In the LDS church, men serve two-year missions and women serve 18-month missions. Both are voluntary, but missions for men are more common and more expected, while female missionaries are less common—but they’re becoming more and more common.Basically, T and I were apart and in different countries, speaking different languages, experiencing very different cultures for 3 years, 1 month, and 24 days (but I didn’t count or anything haha). Even though we were continents apart, I wrote T a letter every single week, and we were able to keep a very close bond despite the distance.Despite staying close via letters and phone calls, through our years apart, we had both changed and grown immensely as individuals by the time we saw each other face to face again. We spent a good year or so dating and becoming re-acquainted, until we got engaged in October 2015 and FINALY got married in the Salt Lake Temple in May 2016.We had a beautiful, early-morning wedding, making sacred covenants to each other and to God, to love and cherish each other throughout the eternities. (LDS members believe they are married for time and all eternity and not “till death do us part.”) It was an absolute fantasy to hold hands and look into my beautiful wife’s eyes as we were declared husband and wife, and then to share our first kiss as a married couple!After the ceremony, we took what felt like thousands of pictures with family and friends, but we absolutely cherished the pictures we took of just T and I. Looking back, it was all a complete whirlwind. But every time I see those pictures, I am overcome with the love in both of our eyes.After pictures, T and I planned to rush to our hotel in downtown Salt Lake City to get checked in and drop off our bags, before rushing back to the family for the Lunch-in, and later the Reception party! (LDS weddings are a full-day affair… or at least they are in our families!)We were lucky enough to have my dad, who had really great connections at the nicest, most ritzy hotel in Utah, and he was able to get us a weekend stay in their honeymoon sweet! This was incredible, because being young and having very little money ourselves, we only had my red tin can of a car, a small, two-bedroom apartment with cinderblock walls, student debt, and give or take a thousand dollars to our name. It wasn’t much, but with my ravishing bride next me in the passenger seat, I felt like the wealthiest man in the world.As we drove, we talked about how the weather had been absolutely perfect, the pictures had gone smoothly, and T teased me about getting teary eyed during the ceremony. (But who wouldn’t when marrying an angel?) Gosh, I love that girl so much!I kept worrying I would crash the car, and caught myself speeding every few minutes because I was so distracted by how stunning T was in her bridal gown. While modest, it was impossible with her figure for her not to have ample cleavage, and I couldn’t help stealing glances, wishing I could see more, and fantasizing about finally being able to trace my hands over her breasts, and feeling her nipples grow hard against my palms. I could feel my member growing erect at the thought.While I was stealing glances, I also caught T doing the same, but her glances were directed a bit more south than mine had been. It was obvious that she liked what she saw, because she kept losing her train of thought every time her eyes drifted to my lap. I kept wishing she would reach over and stroke me, but frustratingly, she stayed on her side of the car.Once we got to the hotel, we realized it was far more lavish than we had expected! It felt like we were staying in Buckingham Palace or the Sistine Chapel! Even in our wedding attire, we felt underdressed. Our bellman took our luggage and led us to our suite, giving us an impromptu tour along the way. He had an impressive accent which we learned was from Barcelona, Spain. (All the staff are required to speak multiple languages). He got very excited when T started talking to him in his native tongue. Listening to her roll her R’s, I couldn’t help but imagine what else her tongue could do, and felt the stiffness in my trousers start to wake again.Our room was nothing short of a dream! It had a beautifully furnished sitting room, and a dining room with a huge balcony, giving an incredible view of the surrounding mountains. We had a bathroom so large you could play baseball in it, with a large, 12-headed shower, a two person sink, vanity table, walk in closest, and a giant two-person tub. (At least, that’s what it was called, but it was more like a four-person tub!)But the central point of the suite was the enormous, lush bed that could easily accommodate any and all nightly adventures we could possibly dream up.And believe me, we were imagining.The tour of the hotel and the suite had taken much longer than we had anticipated, and we were getting very crunched for time in order to get to our lunch-in. We knew if we were late, we would be getting knowing looks and cat calls from family and friends, whether or not anything had happened. So we tried to hurry the bellman out so we could grab the few things we needed for the rest of the nights social engagements and rush out the door.Tipping and thanking the bellman, I was able to close the door, leaving my bride and myself finally alone. Despite being pressed for time, it felt like we could finally relax and breathe for a second.Prior to the wedding day, we had discussed that we wanted to wait until after the reception party to be fully intimate, so when we found ourselves alone in our honeymoon suite, we weren’t antsy to rush into anything, and neither she or I felt any pressure. I shut the door and turned to see my beautiful bride standing beside the bed, smiling at me.“Gosh, I thought he would never leave,” T chuckled as her body visibly relaxed, releasing the pressure that the day’s activities had built.“Me neither,” I laughed as I crossed the distance, enfolding T in my arms. “Took me a second to realize he expected a tip.”Hugging me and looking up and me, T giggled, “Yeah, these aren’t our people.”Smiling down and meeting the stars in her eyes, I was knocked speechless for a second. Lifting my hand to delicately caress her cheek, I leaned in and brushed my lips against hers. As I mentioned earlier, T and I weren’t novices when it came to kissing, but somehow this kiss was complete fireworks. I had only meant to give her a loving peck and then be out the door, but suddenly we found our lips igniting like the 4th of July!T pressed her body against me as my hand went from caressing her cheek to getting tangled in her hair. Small whimpers escaped her lips as our tongues expertly played tag. The erection that had been slowly waking all day was now at nearly full attention, causing me slight pain from it being so confined. I don’t know how long we embraced there, transported by each other to some other place, but it was long enough for the alarm on my phone to start going off, telling us that we needed to leave right this second.Reaching into my jacket pocket, T grabbed my phone, silenced it, and threw it on the bed, then greedily returned to our make-out. As she pressed back against me, she pulled off my form-fitting tux jacket and dropped it to the floor, giving me much more mobility to run my hand over her body.Pulling my lips away for a moment, I gave T a devilish grin and exclaimed, “Well, if we are going to be late anyway, we are going to make the catcalling and looks worth it!”I walked her backwards until she was against the edge of the bed. I gave her a gentle push and made her squeal with delight as she fell back, and now lay on the bed, legs dangling off, looking up at me.Looking down at her and slowly undoing my tie, I asked, “Can I do something I’ve been dying to do for so long?”T nodded and said, “You can doanything. We can doEVERYTHING!” She emphasized the last word, propping herself up on her elbows.Kneeling before my bride, I slowly started to run my hands up her legs, causing her dress to lift and slowly exposing more and more of her body. Looking up at her, it was clear that she was surprised by what I was doing. She was obviously thinking I would have climbed on top of her and buried myself in her breasts. But instead her groom was on his knees, hands gliding up her thighs.As my thumb tentatively brushed up her inner thigh, she started to squirm with anticipation, until it slipped across the wetness her pussy was making. T gasped involuntarily as I found my way to the band of her underwear.Looking her in the eyes, I asked, “Is this okay?”Unable to speak, she nodded, not taking her eyes from mine.With her dress now completely out of the way, I gripped the band of her underwear and slid them down, over her heels and off my bride’s body. For the first time in my life, I saw T’s smoothly shaven pussy, swollen and glistening with arousal. My mouth immediately started to salivate, viewing my wife laid out like a feast before me. And I intended to devour her.Extremely softly, I started kissing and licking my way up her inner thighs, listening to her quietly moaning. Reaching her mound, I could see and faintly smell her delicious cream. Overcome with desire, I placed loving kisses and gently let my tongue trace around her vagina and clit, leaving a small trail of saliva. The edge of my lips made a tiny amount of contact with T’s vulva and clit as I moved my way around, constantly teasing her.“Please baby!” T whimpered, and I obliged, getting to the main course I was lounging for. I Allowed my tongue to drop down over my chin and relax, making it wide and flat, glistening with saliva. I placed it on her vulva and slowly moved my head upwards from the bottom to the top of her begging pussy, passing the tip of my tongue over her swollen pearl. God, she tasted amazing!T gripped the comforter and gasped loudly in ecstasy, thrusting herself up into my wanting mouth as I repeated the action time and time again, keeping a steady rhythm and light, tender pressure on her sensitive clit.Feeling my cock grow harder, I was desperate to release it from its confinement. I undid my belt and trousers with one hand, allowing my ever-stiffening cock to stretch out a little more, relieving some pressure. Keeping my left hand on T’s upper thigh, I reached my dominant hand into my briefs, rearranged my manhood, and started to massage my iron-hard dick while continuing to orally pleasure my bride.Without conscious thought, my mouth encircled T’s clit and I started to gently suck.“Oh my God… J… yes… God yes!” she moaned.Listening to her cries of passion, I knew I was pleasing her, but I needed more. Keeping the steady pressure around her clit, I widened my mouth and slid my tongue in and out of T’s pussy, lapping up and delighting in her cream.T’s movements became more sporadic and intense. Gripping my hair, she pulled my mouth deeper into her. I started eating her with more passion, truly and deeply mouth-fucking her.“OH MY GOD! J! YES! FUUUUCK!” she screamed, bucking uncontrollably, as I witnessed my wife have her first ever oral orgasm. T’s eyes rolled back, her hands gripped the bedspread, she arched her back, and she wrapped her legs around my head with her thighs spasming uncontrollably as the waves of her orgasm crashed over her!Knowing that I had caused her fits of passion nearly drove me over the edge while my firm grip pumped my stiff cock.Coming down from her oral-induced high, she smiled down at me, still kneeling between her legs. She said, “My turn to worship your dick!”Grabbing my hands and pulling me to my feet, T spun us around and yanked my already open pants down around my ankles and sat me on the edge of the bed. She leaned in so I got a glorious look down her cleavage before she started frantically kissing me and undoing the buttons of the shirt and vest. She worked her fingers down my buttons, and her kisses traveled down my jaw… down my neck… down my chest, down my abs, until I was completely bare-chested before her.Now on her knees between my legs, T reached back up and gently clawed her fingernails down my pecs and heaving abs making me shudder. This simultaneously made my dick twitch, and somehow, impossibly, it got even harder.Seeing the movement in my shorts, T grinned and gripped the band of my underwear and pulled them down. As my throbbing cock finally sprang to freedom, it came up and slapped T in the side of her cheek, making her eyes go WIDE and her jaw drop in surprise at its size.Looking back and forth from my eyes to my rigid member, T smiled, biting her lip, and asked, “May I?”“God yes!” I barely got out before her hands and mouth were wrapped around me. Holy shit! It was amazing! She was bobbing up and down and moaning, causing my dick to vibrate.I warned her, “Baby if you keep doing that I’m going to cum!”She audibly let my cock pop out of her mouth, then looked up at me, still pumping me with her hands. “God I love your dick,” she said. “I’m so lucky my husband has such a large dick!”She ran her tongue along my cock from bottom to top along the largest vein, allowing my member to slide across her face. She said, “J, when you are close you need to tell me, because I want you to cum in my mouth. We can’t have you making a mess of my hair and makeup. We’ll make more of a mess.” And with that, her mouth went feverishly back for a second helping.It wasn’t long before I was grunting and moaning that I was going to cum.T latched her mouth around my cock as it began to throb with my orgasm, sending spurt after spurt into her waiting mouth. She swallowed as much as she could, but a dribble of cum still slid down her chin. I flopped down on the bed utterly spent.Getting to her feet, she wiped the excess from her chin. She playfully slapped my leg and said, “J, you better get up and hurry, because we are going to be really late! Now where did you throw my underwear?”
