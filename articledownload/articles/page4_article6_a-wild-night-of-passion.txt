(L) – This story contains strong language.**********PART 1**********The setting sun kissed the horizon, casting a warm glow outside as I sat in the quiet of the living room, the last few rays of light peeking through the blinds. My phone buzzed, pulling me from my trance. I glanced down at the screen to see a message from my young wife, Vanessa, who was at one of her sister’s homes watching movies. She was from a large family, and she and her sisters had a tradition of enjoying a movie night together now and then.As I looked down at her text, I read, “Movie’s almost over. What do you want to do for dinner?”The wheels in my head began to turn, a naughty grin spreading across my face as an impulsive plan took shape.My thumbs danced over the keyboard. “How bout this?” I attached a photo of my long, brown cock, standing at full attention, and hit send.I knew the risks. Her sisters, all very beautiful, would be there sitting beside her, their eyes likely to catch a glimpse as she opened and read the text. But the thrill of it all, the potential scandal, it was intoxicating.I waited, my heart racing with every passing second, until I saw the message had been read. The anticipation grew as I pictured Vanessa opening her phone, her eyes widening as the image filled her screen. Would she laugh? Would she be embarrassed? Would she be mad at me? Or would she be turned on? My cock twitched at the thought.The room grew tense as I waited for a response. The silence was deafening, broken only by the distant sounds of the city outside. And then it came, a single word that sent a shiver down my spine: “Yes.”Not long after, the time came to pick up Vanessa. I walked into her sister’s living room, my heart thudding in my chest. I first noticed the pleasant scent of popcorn, followed by the intoxicating sent of female sweat and estrogen combined with an amalgamation of their various perfumes. I saw Vanessa sitting on a beanbag chair near her sisters. I noticed her flushed face and her sisters’ avoidance of eye contact. Their sultry figures only added to the charged atmosphere. Their diverse beauty was as varied as the shades of their mixed heritage.Each of them looked at me with a mix of embarrassment and intrigue. One of them, named Gemma, was blonde-haired and blue-eyed, and was also blessed with a strong inheritance of the high cheekbones and almond-shaped eyes of their Cherokee ancestry—a stunning combination.Another, named Andrea, boasted an athletic, toned body and wore a small spaghetti-strap halter top, along with yoga pants that complimented her long, slender legs. Her petite Irish features combined wonderfully with an intoxicating honey glow and thick, wavy brunette hair the texture of uncooked ramen pasta, both whispers of their distant African roots.The youngest sister, Irene, was broad-hipped and heavyset and had a bubbly personality, very similar to my own Vanessa, but with a shorter stature and a fairer, milkier complexion than she had.Like my wife, each of her sisters also boasted a bust that seemed to defy gravity, a testament to their shared genetic jackpot. They greeted me in almost indistinguishably similar high-pitched, breathy voices that blended in with my wife’s own “Oh, hello, John.”I smiled and waved. They each returned my smile, but their eyes darted away, unable to hold my gaze for more than a second or two. I felt my eyes drift back to Andrea, appreciating the way her large hoop earrings complimented her cheeks, and the way her nose ring accented her slightly-upturned Irish nose. My eyes drifted downward to her ample cleavage before admiring her toned abs and the piercing that adorned her navel. I couldn’t help letting my gaze drift a bit lower, appreciating the tight curves of her hips and ass, toned from hours of running, and was finally drawn to the visible outline of her slit through the tight, thin fabric of the front of her yoga pants. I felt a thrill as my cock began to harden, and I noticed her honey-toned skin begin to blush a dark color under my gaze.Suddenly, and perhaps intentionally, she crossed her legs and lifted her heavily-tattooed left arm, adjusting her richly-textured hair with her hand, and I saw the glint of her wedding ring and was snapped back into reality as my conscience struck me for lusting after a married woman, and my own sister-in-law at that. I looked around, and saw Vanessa looking at me as I turned away from her sister Andrea, and I tensed as I saw a hint of a storm brewing in her darkening blue-gray eyes.Vanessa gathered her things and we drove home in silence, her hand resting lightly on my thigh. The air between us became more charged as her fingers slowly began tracing circles that grew smaller and smaller until they grazed the growing bulge in my pants. It seems that all thoughts of dinner had somehow escaped both our minds. As soon as the door to our apartment closed behind us, Vanessa’s demeanor shifted.“You’ve been a very naughty boy,” she said, her voice low and sultry. She reached back and slapped my ass—hard—the sound echoing through the hallway. “You know you deserve to be punished for that.”I turned to face her, my heart racing. Her eyes were dark with lust, and she stepped closer, pressing her body against mine. Our lips met, not in the light, playful kiss of the two best friends who got married, but in the deep, passionate kiss of two lovers in heat.Seconds later, with surprising strength, she pushed me down onto the bed, a hint of anger in her touch as her hands moved roughly to my waistband. She tugged at my pants, pulling them down to reveal my hard cock, standing tall and proud.“Looks like someone’s enjoying himself,” she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Let’s see how much you enjoy this,” she added, as she groped me roughly while biting her lower lip.Her fingers reached under my shirt, finding my nipples. She fondled gently with her fingertips, before suddenly digging her long, painted nails into my skin just enough to make me cry out, the sharp pain making my body shudder with a mix of arousal and discomfort.“Oh you like that, don’t you, boy?” she said in a low voice as she did it again.Vanessa’s hand then wrapped around my shaft, her grip firm and sure. She began to stroke me, her eyes never leaving mine. Each movement of her hand sent waves of pleasure through my body, and I could feel myself getting closer and closer to the edge. “You’re going to regret what you’ve done,” she said, her voice playful, yet tinged with a ferocity that frightened me. Her tone softened just a bit as she added, “But maybe, just maybe, I’ll make it worth your while.”Her hand moved faster, her thumb brushing over the sensitive head of my cock. I could feel my orgasm building, the tension in my balls growing with each stroke. “Is this what you wanted?” she asked, a smirk playing at the corners of her mouth. “To have me play with you like this?” Her voice took on a darker tone as she added, “Or did you maybe secretly hope someone else would do it instead?”I could only muster a groan in response, my body quivering with pleasure.The room was a whirlwind of sensation as she continued to touch me. With her free hand, she randomly ripped at her own clothing with an unhinged passion. Her bra fell to the floor, her large breasts bouncing with every movement she made, while her eyes never left mine. The sight was intoxicating, and I could feel my resolve slipping away.“Yes,” I heard myself murmur, my voice strained with desire. My answer terrified me, as I really wasn’t sure if it was an encouragement to her sexual actions, or an answer to her earlier question.She lowered herself slowly, before beginning to softly tease the tip of my erect penis with her tongue. She then took the head in her mouth, sucking softly before nibbling gently with her teeth. I gasped and shook, thinking she was going to finish me right there, but she suddenly broke away with a wicked grin and climbed on top of me, straddling my hips. She pulled my shirt off with such ferocity that I heard the faint rip of the collar tearing slightly. She then reached down, her fingers coated in her own arousal, and began fondling my nipples again. A grimace of arousal on her face, she groped blindly with one hand, finally guiding my cock into her wet pussy.“Now, let’s see if you can handle the punishment,” she said, and began to ride me with an intensity that left me breathless.I couldn’t say for sure, but I almost got the feeling she was rage-fucking me. Her hips rolled in a hypnotic rhythm, each movement sending jolts of pleasure through my body. Her nipples were hard and begging for attention as her breasts bounced rhythmically. I reached up to cup them, feeling their weight in my hands as she moaned in response.The sight of her—her cheeks flushed and eyes glazed with passion—was almost too much. Her movements grew more erratic, and her breaths came in gasps. It didn’t take a sex therapist to inform me that my wife was nearing a ruby-red climax. And as she threw her head back, her eyes squeezed shut, and I knew she was about to come with a vengeance.Her orgasm hit her like a wave, her body convulsing around me. She cried out, her nails digging into my skin as she rode out the pleasure. I could feel her tightening, her muscles contracting around my cock. It was all I needed, and with an intense spasm, I came as well.“Oh yessss!” Vanessa groaned as she felt my cock spurting hot semen into her pussy.We lay there, panting and sweaty, the silence of the room broken only by our ragged breaths. The tension from earlier had transformed into something else, something darker and more primal. The night had taken an unexpected turn, and I knew it was far from over.**********PART 2**********With a sudden shift in momentum, Vanessa rolled me over onto my stomach, her soft hands gripping my hips.“You’ve got quite the ass on you, husband,” she purred, her voice thick with admiration and lust.She began to spank me, her hand coming down in rapid, stinging slaps that made me jump with every impact.“It’s all mine,” she growled, her voice a mix of playfulness and possession. “You’re not for sharing.”I moaned in a mix of pain and pleasure, rolling onto my side. Her hand paused, and I felt her fingers trace the line where my pronounced farmer’s tan ended, the pale sandy color of my upper thighs and ass standing starkly against the deep tanned skin of my legs. My skin was a mix of colors, dark where the sun kissed it, an echo of my Latino and Middle Eastern ancestors, while my more private areas mostly boasted a sandy-pale hue most assuredly given me by my many European forebears.“I like it,” she murmured, her voice filled with lust. “It’s like a treasure map to your cock.”My eyes drifted downward and I took in the deep, dark, brown color of my cock and balls. Suddenly, she rolled me over again and delivered another slap, harder this time, making me moan into the pillow. The sting grew into a warm throb, and with each smack, I could feel myself slowly getting harder again. Vanessa’s breath was hot against my skin as she leaned over me, her breasts pressing into my back.“You’re so naughty,” she whispered, her voice a mix of anger and arousal. “But you know what happens to naughty boys? They always get their comeuppance.”Before I could respond, she began to spank me again, her hand coming down in a relentless rhythm. She was in control, and the knowledge of it made my cock throb with the thrill of being dominated. I could feel my orgasm building, despite the fact that she wasn’t even touching me there. Her words and actions were all the stimulation I needed.She rolled me over, pinning my wrists down above my head, swaying rhythmically above me so that her weighty, pendulous breasts struck me heavily across the face. As each soft, heavy blow claimed my face as her own, I moaned as if in pain. This was all too much for me to handle, and I knew my body would not hold out much longer. I tilted my head forward, desperately trying to kiss and lick the hypnotically swaying breasts, but each time I did, she’d expertly jerk to the side or up and away from me, leaving me whimpering with desperation.And then, without warning, it hit me. I came, my cock spasming and shooting ropes of cum onto her pot belly, the undersides of her large, dangling breasts, and parts of her neck and chin. She suddenly looked downward with the realization I was cumming, and some of my hot semen hit her squarely in the face, making it glint in the dim light. The sensation was overwhelming, and I bucked beneath her, my body a live wire of pleasure.Vanessa sat back, wiping a stray droplet from her chin with a smug smile.“Looks like you enjoyed that,” she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. She licked her lips, tasting me, and the sight was enough to make me want more. “But remember,” she added, her eyes gleaming, “you’re mine, and no one else gets to have this,” she declared possessively, gesturing toward my spent manhood.Her words were like a brand on my soul, searing into my consciousness. The idea of her claiming me so openly, so possessively, was the ultimate turn-on. I knew she was right; no one else would ever get to truly experience this side of me, nor would I want them to.We lay there, panting and spent, the echoes of our passion still hanging in the air. But the night was still young, and I had a feeling this was just the beginning of our little game of naughty and nice.“You know,” Vanessa began, her voice still thick with lust, “I guess I married a bit of an exhibitionist, didn’t I?”Her eyes twinkled with mischief as she straddled me. She took my hand and placed it on her round belly, guiding it down until my fingers brushed against the soft, downy hair leading to her wet pussy.“The way you risk showing off that big, brown cock of yours… it’s like you desperately want it to be seen.” Her voice took on a dark and possessive tone as she added, “But it’s all mine, Johnny.”Her words sent a shiver down my spine, and I couldn’t help but feel a swell of pride. She was right; there was something thrilling about the idea of being watched, admired, even lusted after. There had been something amazing about the thrill of sending her that text, and about the thought of her sisters being aware of the unbridled passion I bestowed on their beloved sibling every night. It all felt so heady and wild. But nothing topped the high of knowing that, no matter how playful or naughty we ever got, no one would ever experience me in the special ways she did. No one would ever have sex with me except for her, nor would anyone ever have sex with her except for me. Those were our marriage vows, and we intend to keep them, ‘til death do us part.My mind was a swirl of thoughts and emotions in the silence that followed, and I needed to know.“Nessa?” I asked. “The dick picture—did anyone else see it? Or did you just mention to them what I did?”Before I could fully finish my sentence, she shoved me down and locked lips with me again, her tongue probing me deeply. I could hardly breathe.She whimpered and sighed, finally freeing my lips just long enough to speak. “Some things are better left a mystery,” she said with an impenetrable poker face, her blue-gray eyes delving deeply into my brown ones.She leaned down once more, her soft, full breasts pressing into my chest, and began to kiss my neck, her tongue tracing the line of my collarbone.“You’re so beautiful,” she whispered, her full lips brushing against my naked flesh as she spoke. “And that cock of yours… it’s like a work of art.”Her praise was like a drug, filling me with a heady mix of desire and vanity. I watched as she took one of my nipples into her mouth, her teeth gently grazing the sensitive flesh. She flicked her tongue across it, teasing and tormenting until it was as hard as my cock was moments before. Her hands roamed my body, exploring every inch of my tanned skin, her touch feather-light, yet filled with a fiery, possessive passion. As she kissed and licked her way down my torso, she paused to admire my cock.“Look at this,” she murmured, her voice filled with awe. “It’s like it was made just to make me happy.”She stared lovingly at it as if it were her prized possession. As her hand trailed down my chest, her fingers lingered over my taut stomach, pausing briefly to trace the scars from a previous surgery, before landing at the base of my cock, which was already showing its first signs of life again after its second orgasm of the night. She began to stroke and squeeze its slightly soft form gently and aimlessly.“I will say this, though,” she murmured, her eyes far off and deep in thought. “I think you liked the idea of my sisters, you know, seeing you like that.”Her words hit me like a bolt of lightning, sending a thrill through my body as my heart skipped a beat. I couldn’t deny it; the thought of them seeing my naked body, my erect penis, and the way it looked when I felt aroused, had all been a powerful aphrodisiac.“Yeah…” I admitted, my voice barely a murmur and my tone betraying a hint of the shame I now felt.Vanessa rolled onto her side, the soft light revealing the luscious curve of her large, rounded breasts. Her impressive areolas—roughly the diameter of baseballs—stood out like dark islands of coral on a sea of creamy-yellow flesh, her erect nipples like the peaks of steep mountains. As she lay on her side, her wide hips gave the impression of a rounded mountain range rising above the vast plains of our bed. She watched my eyes explore her, an expression of thoughtfulness in her own blue-gray irises as she soaked in the attention.“I… I’m not sure how to feel about what you did,” she said, her voice quavering slightly as she spoke. “Honestly, it made me feel a bit angry when it happened. Jealous, even.”“I—I’m sorry!” I said, shaking slightly.She still appeared to be deep in thought as she took her nipple between her fingers and began to toy with it, rolling it gently before giving it a sharp pinch that made her gasp.“Well, what’s done is done,” she said. “I admit though, the naughtiness of what you did really turned me on, too. And I can see why you did it. I know you’ve always found my sisters attractive…” her voice trailed off before adding, “I know you appreciate how… athletic one of them is compared to me…” Her voice was just above a whisper, and stumbled and cracked slightly as she said this.I looked into her eyes and saw tears. Her hand continued to toy with her breast, but I could tell her movements were slowing. She closed her eyes as two large tears streamed down her face. I couldn’t help but move towards her and wrap my arms around her.“I’m so sorry!” I said again as I held her. “You know I never would have matched well with Andrea! Our personalities clash. Besides, she was already dating Mark when I met you. You’re the only one for me, Ness…” My voice trailed off as I held her and stroked her back lovingly.She sobbed into my chest for a good while. Eventually, she opened her eyes to look at me.“I guess I’ll just have to keep an eye on you,” she said, her voice still shaky with emotion as she ran her fingers through my hair. “You’re quite the temptation.” Vanessa reached out and began gently fingering my thick chest hair while finishing her thought. “But for now,” she whispered, “let’s just enjoy this.” She began to rub my chest and shoulders slowly as she gazed into my eyes with a jealous fire that frightened me. “Because, Baby, you’re all mine.”I nodded, as I wrapped my arms around her soft waist and pulled her close.We lay in that state for a long time, listening to the soft sounds of the night outside our window, silently savoring one another’s company.**********PART 3**********I stroked her slightly coarse, messy hair and admired those beautiful eyes, which seemed to be deeply lost in thought. Without warning, I noticed a faint gleam of rebellion flash across them, as she suddenly squirmed closer to me and allowed her full lips to find my neck. Her kisses were tender, meandering, and playful. She paused and looked into my eyes, a slight smirk playing across her face.“We both already know you fantasize about being watched. But what about me? How would you feel about someone else seeing these?” she asked, as she playfully cupped her hands underneath her voluminous breasts and gave them a shake. “How would you feel about them seeing me do this?” she added, as she licked both her fingers and began to gently swirl them across her large areolas, before moving in closer and flicking seductively at each nipple.My heart rate quickened as I saw her eyes slowly close as she began to embrace her newfound fantasy. I saw the corners of her mouth twitch as her full lips parted in a breathless smile.“That really turns me on,” I replied, my breath catching.Her hands still pleasuring her breasts, she leaned forward and whispered into my ear, her breath hot and tickling, “Do you know what they used to do in ancient times?”I could feel my heart racing, my body responding to her every touch, every word.“At weddings,” she continued, “the guests would watch the bride and groom consummate their marriage. Can you imagine that?”The thought of being watched, of us both performing for an audience of eager eyes, was surprisingly arousing. I could feel my cock begin to swell once more as she spoke. It poked her soft flesh, causing her to gasp almost imperceptibly and look down.“Ohhh, does that turn you on, Baby?” she cooed, her full lips upturned in a wickedly delightful smile, her voice a seductive purr.And with a shiver of excitement, I admitted to her that it did—more than anything else I had ever imagined.Her eyes searched mine, looking for any signs of hesitation. I was an open book to her, and she only saw raw, unbridled desire in my eyes. She leaned closer, her breasts pressing into me, her scent more than intoxicating.“Imagine it,” she urged, her voice a soft command as she waved her hand dramatically above her head. “Imagine everyone watching as I take all of you inside me. Can you feel them all around us? Can you hear their voices? Can you see the arousal in their faces as you and I indulge in every passionate, intimate, obscene sex act imaginable under their watchful gaze?”My imagination took hold, and I could almost feel the eyes of the invisible onlookers on us, their breaths hitching in anticipation as she and I began to move together. The thought was overwhelming, a heady mix of primal instinct and raw exhibitionism at its most unbridled.Just then, Vanessa straddled me, her wetness coating my hips as she began to slowly and seductively kiss and lick my neck and chest while grinding against my body.Her sweaty, thick hair clung to my face as she bent down and nibbled my earlobe, heat radiating off her body as she squirmed on top of me, her movements slow and deliberate.“Look at me,” she ordered, her voice becoming husky with lust. “Look at me!” She repeated. “Imagine everyone watching us, wanting to be us.”As she said this, she leaned back and let her arms fall loosely at her sides, exposing her body more fully to my view as she closed her eyes and began to writhe seductively, her bosom quivering with the sultry motions of her shoulders as her mouth twitched unconsciously, baring her teeth, her thoughts clearly fueling such an intense state of arousal that it made her face appear to be in a state of agony.I did as she said, and my eyes locked onto her as she reached blindly and began to massage and play with her breasts once more—but this time for the pleasure of a large, imaginary audience as much as for her own and mine. Her face and chest were deeply flushed and glistened with her sweat. Her breasts bounced in time with each of her movements, and her eyes continuously opened and closed slowly as if she was under the influence of a powerful narcotic. I saw them darkening and dilating, making her appear as if she were in some sort of trance. It was as if the sheer force of her erotic thoughts had transported us into a different place and time.The room was alive with the sounds of our sultry passion—the slow slap of skin on skin, the wet rhythm of our love. If our first liaisons with each other that night had been like cold and rushing white water rapids, this one was like a wide, churning river under the stars, in the sweltering heat of the Deep South.Sweat poured down both of our faces as her hands found my strong shoulders, her nails slowly digging in as she bowed herself down on me, her voice almost a whisper.“Fuck me,” she gasped, before letting a faint moan escape her lips. She gasped once more, her body spasming once, then she moaned loudly as if she was under some sort of intense pressure or pain, her voice echoing throughout the room. “Fuck me like everyone’s watching!”Her voice was a shrill and desperate plea, a plea which I did not dare deny her. I obeyed, slowly and deliberately rolling her over and pressing her into the bed while climbing atop her nude form, one hand cradling her head and neck, the other reaching down to grope her until I felt the soft fuzz of her pubic hair. I aimed my firm erection into her inviting, dripping wetness. As I did so, my hips began to thrust automatically, each movement of hers inviting me deeper.The fantasy grew more intense as we made love, and I could feel the gaze and hear the sounds of the unseen spectators all around us, our pleasure fed by their hunger for it. I grabbed her breasts, and her breath grew ragged, her moans more frequent. Although our bodies were already tired and spent from the passion we had already shared that night, we were deep in the throes of our shared fantasy, and the arousal coursing through our veins caused us to continue to dance together in the most erotic of ways.But it was when she suddenly rolled me over, reversing our positions, that the true power of the situation hit me. She sat astride me, her large breasts swaying as she took control.“Look at us,” she gasped, her face contorting with a passion almost too intense to describe, her eyes flashing with a fire that made me shake. “We’re the show, Baby. They’re all watching, all wishing they could have this.” Her voice came in short bursts as she gasped for air, continuing to verbalize her erotic thoughts with each breathy exhalation. “Listen to the labored breathing all around us. Listen to them gasp and swear. Watch as they shed their clothing. Look around you and see the men grabbing at their hard cocks, the women exploring their own breasts and pussies…”As she finished this last word, her soft voice sounded in short, breathless gasps, and trailed off into an unintelligible, shrill squeal of pure thrill and pleasure. I watched her, her eyes wild with passion as she intensely orgasmed. Her body twitched, and her head lolled backward and forward uncontrollably, her legs tightening like a vice around my waist. Suddenly, she cried out, “More!” before a wordless and animalistic bellow escaped her open mouth.She began to ride me harder, her sexual appetite clearly not yet sated. Her quivering pussy was tight and wet, and her movements frantic as she again cried out, “More!!” She rocked herself desperately around my brick-hard cock, which was rapidly edging toward its third orgasm of the night. The room was thick with a dark energy, almost quaking with Vanessa’s raw and untamable sexual arousal. I could feel her orgasm building again, and it was like watching a dangerous storm approaching on the horizon.My passion rose like a raging flood. I pounded her wildly, the force of my thrusts easily lifting her heavyset frame about a foot off the bed. She threw her head back, her breasts bouncing with every thrust, and I knew we were both on the edge once more. Her hand found my chest again, her nails digging into my skin, her grip tightening as she rode me. “Cum for them,” she said, her voice a demand. “Cum for me.”But our focus was broken almost simultaneously as the sound of a twig cracked loudly just outside our open window-screen, and the faint scent of smoke began to tickle our nostrils. I had paused mid-thrust, my rock-hard cock still aching for release, and turned to see smoke wafting softly in from behind the closed blinds of our bedroom window. Both of our bodies trembled wildly with the combined panic and thrill of the moment. It felt as if anything could happen now.Vanessa’s eyes widened with the realization, and she shakily whispered to me, “Someone’s outside.”I knew the safety bracket I had installed on our open window would keep it from being opened wide enough for someone to slip through, and yet I half wondered to myself if I should make a mad dash for my Tokarev in order to protect my young and defenseless wife. Instinctively, I pushed Vanessa off of me and began to scramble towards the edge of our bed.She grabbed my hand. “Wait!” she whispered.We stayed on the bed in the darkness for a few seconds as the smoke grew denser, and we could almost feel the heat of it. The smoky, slightly minty scent was familiar now, and a thrill shot through me, and I knew she felt it too. Our eyes met as we both realized who it was. Our neighbor—a nerdy, socially-awkward young man—had been known to sit on the stairs outside our apartment, enjoying the quiet moments of the evening and smoking menthol cigarettes. The realization that he had probably heard the loud sounds of our passion and had voyeuristically come outside to better hear it through the covered but open window-screen, only heightened the already extreme state of arousal we had been sharing in. My cock began to twitch again with excitement.Vanessa lay back down, a seductive smile on her face as if the audience she had fantasized about was now a reality, and she wasn’t about to let this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity slip by her.She pulled me roughly towards her by my arm, and began French kissing me passionately, her voice erupting in muffled whimpers as she did so. No longer worried about the smoke, and perhaps even spurred on by it, I climbed on top of her, returning her wild kisses. Without a word, Vanessa reached up and put me into something like an overhook one might see in an MMA fight, before pulling my head down into her quivering bosom, as her face turned ever so slightly away from me and her eyes locked onto the window. I knew what she wanted, and I obliged without a word.I explored every inch of my wife’s voluptuously beautiful bosom with my lips and tongue, and as the smoke grew thicker, it was as if we found a renewed energy and our lovemaking shifted into a gear neither of us even knew existed.Her eyes were hooded with passion, but still glued to the window as her body squirmed. She reached with her free hand to corral the abundant flesh of one of her breasts, pinching the area around the nipple and offering it up to my lips. Somehow, the thought of our neighbor’s ears drinking in the sounds of my sucking and slurping on Vanessa’s Playboy-centerfold-worthy tits only served to make me harder and bigger than I ever thought possible. Vanessa moaned shakily as my cock stretched her out, my suckling becoming louder and more erratic, and I knew the same naughty thoughts were filling her mind as well. Namely, I wondered if we could be seen through the small gap between the blinds and the window, and I admit I silently hoped a sudden wind gust would throw them open wide, exposing Vanessa and myself to the gaze of our auditory voyeur, if only for a moment.I reached down and groped wildly until I felt my hands grab onto large hips, and began to fuck her with a renewed vigor. As the bed creaked and protested under the movements, Vanessa’s huge tits danced wildly up and down, slapping audibly against her shoulders and jawline before bouncing back down toward her sides, hitting me as I straddled her. I arched my back away as I instinctively tried to drill a hole through her pussy. It seemed as though every ounce of strength in my body was behind each of my thrusts. We didn’t hold back, our loud moans and gasps filling the room and drifting outside.We looked into each other’s eyes, a mischievous sparkle shared in wordless communication: we were sure of it now—he really was listening—and something about that knowledge made us cast away all our inhibitions. The high was so intense that, I’ll be honest, if I hadn’t been so busily occupied in the bed at that very moment, I would have impulsively thrown open the window shades and gladly exposed our bodies to his view. Meanwhile, the smoke only grew more intense. Something deep inside me wondered if he was masturbating now, and I pondered if Vanessa was thinking the same.Our hearts raced, and our desire for each other grew ever stronger. We had an audience, and it was a heady feeling. Our sex-sounds echoed our excitement, becoming a roaring symphony of passion that pierced the stillness of the night.Vanessa’s eyes glazed over with pleasure as she wrapped her legs around me, pulling me in deeper until I finally felt sweet resistance as I plunged into her very depths, her nails digging into my back each time my rock-hard glans reamed her. As we neared our climax, the puffs of smoke grew rapid, like little puffs of air pushing in to hear the crescendo of our lovemaking. The smell of it was intoxicating, mixing with the scent of our sex. We could almost physically feel the attention of our neighbor focusing in on us, his own desires kindled by the sounds of our union.Our movements grew more erratic, more desperate, and as we neared our peak, it almost felt like we might die of pleasure.Vanessa threw her head back, her eyes rolling in uncontrolled motions and her face contorting violently as she came hard around me. I followed soon after, my orgasm tearing through me like a wild beast, leaving me spent and gasping for air. The smoke grew still, but we knew he was still there, because we heard his soft movements just outside.Our bodies finally stilled, and the last of the smoke curled around us like a lover’s caress. We lay there, panting, our hearts hammering in our chests. The knowledge that we had been listened to throughout our most intimate of moments was an aphrodisiac more potent than any drug. We may have not been watched (and still haven’t been as of the date of this writing, as far as I know), but at least we can say that we’ve been listened to, and that definitely felt like a satisfying consolation prize—one which, in terms of pleasure and eroticism, was quite the comparable thrill in my mind.With a final, exhausted sigh, Vanessa lifted her head once more, her eyes straining towards the window, before they suddenly closed and her body went limp, with only her arms still embracing me like a vice. We both had nothing left.We lay there gasping for air, our hearts beating as one, the smoke dissipating slowly into the night sky as we heard our neighbor eventually gather himself and rise to his feet, the soft shuffling of his footsteps getting quieter with every step. We then heard the sound of his door shutting, seeming to put a seal of finality on the craziness of our wild, passionate night.And for me at least, it was as if the world outside ceased to exist, and all that remained was the heat of Vanessa’s body pressed against mine. Her large breasts felt like warm pillows beneath my cheek, and the scent of our lovemaking filled my nostrils. Our sweat-slicked, orgasm-soaked bodies were sticking together, a delicious mess of passion and desire. We were a tapestry of limbs, our skin a canvas painted with the colors of our arousal. The night air took on a cooler temperature, and Vanessa’s breathing evened out—I knew she was close to sleep.But before she could drift away completely, I whispered, “Nessa?”She looked up at me, her eyes heavy-lidded and hazed with satisfaction. “Yeah?”“Do you think he liked the show?” I asked, a smirk playing at the corners of my tired and sweaty face.She giggled, a sweet sound that sent a shiver down my spine. “I don’t know,” she murmured, her voice thick with sleep. “But I know I did.” Her hand found mine, and she gave it a squeeze. “And that’s all that matters,” she said, her soft voice like a gentle lullaby. “As long as we’re together, we can give each other everything we need.”We lay there, cocooned in our love, our bodies still pulsing slightly every now and then with the aftershocks of our pleasure. Her hand was soft and warm against my skin as she drifted off, mindlessly tracing idle patterns that sent little jolts of electricity through me. And with the quiet sounds of the sleeping city as our backdrop, we fell into an exhausted slumber, my head nestled in the softness of her breasts, the sticky warmth of our shared wetness binding us together.As the hours ticked by, the room grew cold, but we didn’t even notice. We slept the sleep of two exhausted lovers who were completely lost in each other, our recent shared high producing a powerful chemical bond between us, and our deeply-rooted love providing a warm embrace that chased away the chill of the night. The moon cast a silver glow across our naked bodies, the comforting natural light playing over the swells and valleys of our forms. It seemed to soothe away the worries of a young married couple trying to build a beautiful sexual relationship that would stand the test of time.Although it took effort and commitment, the truth is that we were one—connected not just by flesh, but by the unspoken understanding of the deep love and intimacy we shared. Our dreams were filled with images of the future—of more nights like this, of the erotic passion that was steadily rising from the foundation of the deep and committed friendship that predated our romance. And even in my sleep, I knew that nothing could ever tear us apart.The next morning, the sun rose to find us still intertwined, the disturbed sheets and scattered clothing a reminder that last night’s events were not a mere wet dream. We stirred slowly, our eyes meeting with a shared smile. The tension of the night before had transformed into something beautiful yet calm, a bond that had grown stronger in the face of our shared fantasies that we had courageously discussed and expressed to each other openly. As I looked at my wife in the morning light, I felt a sense of contentment as I realized that we were learning to tame and direct our desires into passion for each other, strengthening the monogamous devotion of our young marriage.Vanessa leaned in, her soft, plush lips brushing against mine, as she whispered, “Thank you for last night.”“Thank you,” I murmured back, my voice thick with emotion. “For everything.”
