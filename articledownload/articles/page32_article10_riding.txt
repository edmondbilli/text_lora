This is a short post, but I wanted to share the delightful little session I had a few days ago.I had begun, as usual, with towel-grinding, then rubbed and teased my vulva with my fingers.  Once I was wonderfully wet and had fingered myself a few times, I got my vibe out.  It wouldn’t go in easily, so I rebooted my natural lubrication with more grinding and then more fingering.  The vibe slid right in.For a few minutes, I laid on my back on the floor. My legs were up and bent, and I worked the vibe around like I was stirring my inner juices.  But I was in somewhat of a hurry (I think I was trying to finish so I could go shower).  I turned to my right side, my left leg hooked on the edge of the bed, and continued screwing myself.  Then I did something I don’t think I’ve ever tried before. I rolled onto my belly and imagined I was lying on my future husband and riding him.That’s a really awkward position if you’re masturbating yourself with a toy. My hips were raised a bit to make room for my hand. But lying on my own arm is not comfortable.  However, the sensations flooding my pussy were amazing in this new position.  I undulated on the vibe and screwed it in every direction inside me, and dredged up a delicious hot orgasm.  The wave of trembling lasted quite a few seconds.  I felt wetness seeping all over my hand and the vibe.Whew! Another blest episode of sexual discovery!  I praise God for these milestones.  And I can’t wait to try all these incredible things with the man God has set apart for me.
