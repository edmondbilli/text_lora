I really enjoy stories of couples growing together in their marriage, and especially as it relates to this site, growing in their sex life. Most recently, oldtimer shared an example that was really inspiring.I wonder how many of you would be willing to share some examples of how you have grown or developed sexually in your marriage?I also wonder if any of the singles here would be willing to share something youâ€™ve learned about what your body enjoys or responds to that you might not have considered when you first started masturbating?
