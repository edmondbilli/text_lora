Young wife needing advice…I enjoy nipple stimulation with my husband of 8 years. We are a Christian couple and I would love if this type of stimulation could become a regular part of our life together. Honestly I’m afraid of how much nipple play pleases me. I understand it’s not a sin within marriage but I still feel strange to make the request for stimulation to my breasts.My husband has a tendency to shy away from anything that may seem “taboo” so I’m careful to not use words like “dry nursing” even though that would be the ideal experience for me.My main question is, are there any sexy and comfortable positions for a longer nipple sucking experience for my husband? (I have larger sized breasts). If I ask for this often I want this to be enjoyable for him as well.Thank you in advance.
