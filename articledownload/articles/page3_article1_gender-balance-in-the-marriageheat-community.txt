I have a tendency to peruse different stories on this site and look at the comments of others. I see a lot of the same names over and over, which really isn’t unusual, some are just more outspoken than others.Out of curiosity, what is the balance of gender here? From my estimations, I would say it’s probably three to one in favor of men. I could be way off of course, but does anybody have an idea? And why is it that more women are not creating or commenting?The understanding that we have about this site is that it is meant for couples to improve their sexual lives. And as a couple, we do both enjoy it.But the question remains as to women’s membership and contribution here. It’s always a good thing to get the female perspective.
