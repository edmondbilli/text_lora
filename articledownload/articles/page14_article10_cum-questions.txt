When talked about in many stories, male ejaculate is often described as having a bleachy scent and a somewhat salty flavor.At worst, it is usually described as bad or unpleasant. A few accounts will label it as an acquired taste, and fewer still will mention it in a totally positive light.I have no desire to impugn anyone’s opinion or experience, but as man, it does hurt to see these negative reviews. For what I would think a large majority of men feel, ejaculate is the most intimate and sacred part of our sexuality. To have it rejected is, in a sense, rejecting the man.Now, to be fair, I don’t have, (and will never have), any experience with anyone’s semen but mine. I have tasted mine many times and don’t find it salty or bitter. It does have a unique flavor, but I don’t find it unpleasant at all. In addition, the scent is one that I can only describe as sexual.So, my questions for the MH community:How do you rate your or your spouse’s semen?Does diet and/or health affect it?Do you feel as I do about the intimacy connected with a man’s ejaculate?As always, singles feel free to chime in with your thoughts or opinions.
