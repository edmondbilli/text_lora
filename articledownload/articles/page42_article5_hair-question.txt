As I ponder the human body and discover my aesthetic likes and dislikes, I’ve come to a conclusion. I do NOT like body hair.By this I mean that I hate it on myself and find it very unattractive on women.  For men, it depends.  I sometimes like a hairy chest, and usually hairy arms and legs.  But the smooth look is sexy too, as long as it isn’t girly.  Armpit hair is a major turn-off for me.Now, when it comes to my own body, keeping up with all the hair is annoying to say the least.  I wish females had no hair follicles on the armpits or legs, or around the mouth. Frankly, also on the pubic area.  Yes, that’s coming from the girl who used to prefer just a trimmed bush.  Now I shave smoothly because I can FEEL so much more!The problem is, it grows back within a day and gets scratchy and irritated.  I want to try waxing, but it can be expensive.  I’ve made my own sugar wax and de-hair’d my own face and armpits from time to time. But that entails letting the hair grow out, and in the meantime… I’m like Sasquatch.  Not very feminine or attractive!Another trouble area is nipples.  I get very thick, wire-like hairs around my nipples.  Is that normal? Do any of you ladies have this? What do you men think of it? What are some methods the ladies here employ to remove unwanted hair, especially on legs and vulva? And what are the general thoughts on body hair from this group? I’m interested to know what people like.  Especially men. 😁
