Hello,I’ve randomly but very pleasantly stumbled on this community. From what I’ve read it’s amazing, so wholesome, and perhaps the perfect safe space to finally bring my story to light and also ask questions.I wrote an entire backstory, however it got quite long so I decided to delete it and keep it short.I honestly can’t believe I’m 37. I feel 28.I entered a relationship at 28 and from then till now, plus the pandemic, it really seems like a blur that didn’t happen.Anyways, I’ve been wondering why ever since that relationship I haven’t felt drawn to anyone, nor have I felt like my divine man is even out there. At times, I feel like my life was designed to be a testimony of stories rather than get married or procreate.That is, until recently.Lately, I’ve been getting this sexual energy around me—like I’m feeling someone else’s energy that wants me, but it’s not mine. I don’t have other guys around me either.At first, I thought it might be my hormones—I usually get very in the mood just before my monthly period—but it’s not that.So my question is purely for curiosity sake: before you met your godly chosen spouse, did you “feel” it spiritually?What’s the story? Were they around the same neighborhood? How did you manage these overwhelming feelings that bubble up through out the day? This energy that I’m feeling is right up in my space making me feel hot and bothered while I’m alone. It’s funny really.
