Hi, MHers. I wanted to start a thread for sex toys. Feel free to ask questions yourself.I’d like to buy a sex toy that focuses on my wife’s clit, like maybe a clamp that provides pleasure or a vibrating, sucking toy. My wife hates loud toys. I don’t know much about sex toys that aren’t dildos or Fleshlights.What would you recommend?Thanks in advance.
