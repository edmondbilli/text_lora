My wife is currently nine weeks pregnant with our first kids. (Weâ€™re having twins!)Â  While we are both very excited, M is unfortunately having a really rough go of things, with constant sickness (which thankfully they put her on medicine for, and it has helped tremendously) and exhaustion. And the poor thing has been so tender and swollen in her nether regions that sex has been off the table longer than we have ever gone without sex together.I was curious about a few different things, and I was hoping you all might be able to share some advice ðŸ™‚1. For the ladies here, was there anything you did that maybe helped with your discomfort during your pregnancy?Â  And not just sexually, mind you, but other things as well?2.Â  Any advice for me?Â  Itâ€™s hard since I canâ€™t just make things better for her, but I am hoping I can make it easier.Â  From the wives and the husbands here, is there any advice for me on what I can be doing or preparing?3.Â  Any sex advice you could give?Â  Weâ€™ve been masturbating a lot together (which has been a lot of fun, but holy cow, we miss sex.)Â  As far as masturbating together, any fun stuff you can suggest?Â  And when we can start having sex again, any advice or suggestions there?
