(A) – This story contains anal play, including analingus and anal intercourse.(L) – This story contains strong language.The hum​ of the motorhome’s tyres against the road was monotonous,​ a ceaseless lullaby that did little​ to engage Andrea. She sighed, stretching her arms over her head, feeling restless​ in the plush passenger seat. Gabriel, the dutiful driver, remained focused, his hands firm​ on the wheel​ as the countryside unfurled around them. Eight hours​ on the road with​ no stops? That would not do.“We need​ to stop,” she declared, feigning urgency. “Carrefour. For provisions.”Gabriel exhaled sharply, eyeing her from the corner​ of his vision. “We have food​ in the caravan.”“Not the right food,” she countered with​ a pout. “Something fresh. Healthy.”He caved with​ a shake​ of his head, signalling the turn-off. The supermarket loomed ahead,​ a necessary detour she was determined​ to make worth their while.​ As Gabriel manoeuvred the cumbersome motorhome​ to the far side​ of the parking lot,​ he focused​ on securing the vehicle before heading inside.The moment​ he stepped out, Andrea sprang into action. The dull travel outfit was abandoned for something wholly inappropriate:​ a tight black crop top, its deep neckline leaving little​ to the imagination,​ a scandalous mini skirt, white crochet lace ankle socks, and kitten heels that clicked sharply against the pavement​ as she descended the three steps. The breeze teased the bare skin​ of her thighs, amplifying the delicious anticipation curling​ in her stomach.Inside the establishment, Gabriel was oblivious, already weaving through the aisles, filling​ a basket with necessities. Meanwhile, Andrea found​ a cart, one wheel wobbling​ in protest, and set off, idly perusing the shelves with mischief​ in mind.When Gabriel finally rounded​ a gondola, his breath caught​ in his chest.In her entirely age-inappropriate outfit, Andrea was​ a vision​ of barely contained mischief. The curve​ of her bare thighs, the soft dip​ of her collarbone peeking from her top—he felt​ a hot rush​ of arousal, his grip tightening around the basket handle.She turned, catching his gaze, and bit her lip knowingly.“Do we need cereal?” she asked innocently before bending down​ to retrieve​ a box from the lowest shelf.Gabriel barely stifled​ a groan.​ No knickers. The realisation struck him with force,​ a primal need surging within him​ as​ he took​ in the smooth, unblemished curve​ of her bare flesh beneath the skirt. Heat pooled low​ in his stomach, and his throat suddenly dried.She stood back up, placed the box into the cart, and pretended not​ to notice how his chest rose and fell too quickly. Moving forward, she continued their search for provisions, stopping repeatedly​ to retrieve items from the bottom shelves. Each movement was intentional: her skirt lifting just enough and her spine’s slow, deliberate arch.Then came the jars.​ A selection​ of preserves held demurely against her chest​ as she presented them for his consideration.“Peach​ or raspberry?”Gabriel clenched his jaw. Enough.Andrea smirked​ as she placed the jars​ in the cart and turned towards aisle six. She trailed her fingers along the shelves, finally stopping​ in front​ of the toiletries section.​ A mischievous smile played​ on her lips​ as she plucked​ a small bottle​ of lubricant from the shelf, holding​ it​ up for Gabriel​ to see.“We might need this,” she murmured, her voice velvety with implication.Gabriel’s control frayed. Without​ a word,​ he grabbed her wrist, his grip firm but urgent, and dragged her towards the exit. Andrea gasped but followed her pulse racing. When they reached the caravan, Gabriel wasted​ no time, hauling her inside and slamming the door shut.She barely had time​ to laugh before​ he tossed her onto the bed, his body towering over hers, eyes dark with desire.“You think you’re funny?”​ he said.“I think you like it,” Andrea smirked.She still clutched the small bottle​ of lube​ in her fingers, and with slow, deliberate movements, she let​ it trail from her chin down her throat. The cool plastic teasingly contrasted against her heated skin. Gabriel’s gaze tracked the motion hungrily, his chest rising and falling with barely holding restraint.Her hand continued its path, gliding lower, slipping between her breasts, the slick bottle nestled between them for​ a fleeting moment before she pressed​ it further down, over her stomach, towards the waistband​ of her skirt.“You were​ so eager​ to get​ me out​ of there,” she purred, tilting her hips slightly beneath him. “You didn’t even let​ me pay for this.”Andrea looked​ up​ at him with big blue eyes and smiled​ at the bulge​ in his jeans. She stretched out her arm and ran the end​ of the lube bottle over Gabriel’s zipper.​He hissed and ground his hips towards her, his erection straining for attention. She slipped the bottle further down, running​ it along his length through the rough denim.“Let’s see​ if​ I can make your cock​ a little harder,” she said, slipping her top over her head.​A strangled moan escaped his lips. “Fuck, Andrea.”She giggled​ as she circled her thumb and forefinger around the base​ of her nipples. Andrea’s other hand slipped under her dress and between her legs, and her breath caught.“So wet,​ so ready for you,” she whispered, her voice​ a husky purr.Gabriel’s mouth watered, his body trembling with the effort​ to stay​ in control.Andrea slid the round top​ of the lube bottle between her labia​ as she scrunched her breast with her other hand.“Gabriel,enlève ton jean,” she said desperately.Gabriel obliged and pulled his jeans down, and Andrea’s mouth dropped open​ as she stared​ at his massive, throbbing erection.“Oh​ my God, you’re​ so big!” she said.Gabriel grinned​ as​ he stroked his cock.Sitting up, she held his cock with deliberate care, moving​ it slowly, her fingers teasing and tracing the soft veins beneath. Tilting her head slightly, she let the tip hover in suspense for just a moment before she parted her lips, letting her warm breath ghost over it. Her tongue flicked out and gave a playful swirl around the tip before she parted her lips wider, wrapping them around​ it with languid ease.Gabriel groaned​ at the soft, wet slurp that echoed​ in the​ RV​ as she took​ it​ in slowly, her cheeks hollowing, creating​ a gentle suction.​ A quiet hum vibrated against his cock​ as she withdrew, her tongue dragging along its length, leaving​ a glistening sheen​ in its wake.She sucked again, this time with​ a bit more pressure,​ a wet, muffled “Mmph” escaping​ as her lips glided downward.​ A teasing pop followed​ as she let​ it slip free, only​ to take​ it back in, her tongue tracing delicate patterns. Another slow, slickschlpfilled the air, her rhythm deliberate, her every movement measured for maximum effect.Andrea parted her lips, taking the shaft deep with​ a wet, eager slurp, her cheeks hollowing again​ as she increased her pace. Each movement was faster, slicker, her tongue swirling​ as soft, muffled moans escaped her throat​ as she enjoyed Gabriel’s shaft​ in her mouth.In one hand she cradled his balls, rolling them between her fingers, the smooth surface shifting​ as she twirled her fingers. Her other hand worked the tip​ of the lube tube along the length​ of her labia, and then she pressed​ it into her pussy. She began​ to slide​ it​ in and out​ of her heat frantically. Her juicy lips yielded with every thrust.“Putain,” Gabriel groaned, his breath ragged, watching her with dark, hungry eyes. The air between them was electric, thick with anticipation.With​ a sharp growl, Gabriel pushed her onto her back, his eyes wild and hungry​ as​ he spread her legs apart, baring her glistening sex​ to his hungry gaze.​ He grunted​ as​ he shuffled frenetically, his feet out​ of the jeans bunched​ at his ankles.His cock, rock hard and glistening, bobbed before him​ as​ he let out​ a deep, primal grunt.​ He positioned himself above her, grasped her hands and raised them above her head​ as his gaze locked​ on hers. Gabriel’s hips angled downward, and​ he pressed the tip​ of his erection​ to her slick opening.“Mmm,oui,” Andrea moaned, her body writhing, desperate for the contact.Gabriel sank into her with one swift, powerful thrust,​ a low, feral grunt spilling from his lips​ as her wet heat enveloped him. The angle was perfect, his cock driving deep inside her, bottoming out. His pace was relentless. Each thrust was​ a punishing reminder​ of her tease​ in the supermarket.“Est-ce​ ce que​ tu voulais​?Hmm?” Gabriel growled, his hips snapping against hers with bruising force.“Oui!It’s what​ I wanted,” she cried out, her voice rising and breaking​ as​ he continued​ to pound into her, her body bouncing against the mattress.She cried out, her voice rising and breaking​ as​ he continued​ to pound into her, her body bouncing against the mattress. Each thrust sent tremors through the motor home, the suspension creaking​ in protest. The small space around them seemed​ to close in, the rhythmic rocking​ of their bodies making the entire vehicle sway.Andrea’s hands grasped​ at the sheets above her head, then​ at his shoulders—at anything that might ground her against the relentless force​ of his movements. Her breath came​ in sharp gasps, her moans spilling freely until she felt it—the unmistakable jolt​ of the motor home shifting slightly​ on its wheels.The windows had fogged up, condensation against the glass muffling the outside world.But then voices. The faint sound​ of footsteps just beyond the thin walls.Andrea’s eyes widened. “Gabriel,” she panted, pressing​ a desperate hand​ to his mouth. “Shh! We’re​ in the parking lot.”But​ he didn’t stop.​ If anything, the warning seemed​ to spur him on.​ He groaned into her palm, his hips snapping harder against her, each thrust sending another wave through the motorhome. The creak​ of the bed and the stifled sounds​ of their bodies colliding were all​ so loud and unmistakable. Andrea bit her lip, the excitement​ of the location and people pushing her closer​ to her orgasm. Her head fell back against the pillow, torn between mortification and sheer, breathless pleasure. Outside, voices faded, but the thrill remained. And Gabriel had​ no intention​ of slowing down.Andreas’s orgasm arrived like​ a tsunami, hitting her with​ a stunning force that overwhelmed her senses. She arched off the bed, her muscles clenching and fluttering around his shaft. She cried out loudly, the sound raw and wanton, her orgasm washing over her like​ a tidal wave. Gabriel gripped her hips, his fingers digging into her flesh​ as​ he drove into her again and again, the bed groaning​ in protest.Andrea went rigid and stiff, her toes curling​ in her shoes. She squeezed Gabriel’s body with her legs, and her hands clawed​ at his bum, pulling him into her cunt​ as she shuddered​ in heavenly moans below him. Her mind gone into​ a euphoric state​ of bliss.Gabriel felt her succumb below him into​ a mass​ of quivering muscles, her skin slick with sweat. His cock twitched as​ he felt her muscles relax around his cock. Andrea let out​ a tiered gasp, the air thick with the scent​ of their exertions.Gabriel slowed down, moving his shaft​ in little pushes into her heat​ as she quivered below him.“Where​ is the tube​ of lubricant?​ I don’t think​ we can take​ it back now,”​ he said​ as​ he kissed her.Andrea giggled​ as she looked around and saw the tube was​ on the floor.“Guess we’re gonna have​ to keep it,” she said with​ a sultry laugh, pointing​ to it.“Faire demi-tour,”​ he ordered.Gabriel pulled out and reached for the tube. When his gaze returned, Andrea was​ on all fours. Her skirt was pulled​ up over her bum, and her back curled​ in​ a slow, deliberate stretch, every inch​ of her body open​ to him. Gabriel’s gaze trailed down, lingering​ on the smooth expanse​ of her skin, the soft dip between her hips, and finally, the dark, puckered circle nestled between the curves​ of her body.​ He gave​ a little whistle​ as the heat pooled low​ in his stomach​ at the sight​ of it,​ so intimate,​ so vulnerable.She felt his stare,​ a shiver rippling down her spine, anticipation coiling deep within her. The awareness​ of his eyes​ on her made her pulse quicken, her breath turning shallow. Her fingers curled against the sheets​ as she fought the urge​ to press back,​ to demand his touch silently.Gabriel opened the tube and squelched lube onto his palm, rubbing​ it along the length​ of his shaft.​ He leant forward and rimmed her hole, his tongue circling her arse before flicking​ it over the dark brown hole.Gabriel pressed his index finger​ to her tight hole and gently lubricated​ it before inserting​ it into her. Andrea moaned​ at the feeling. She had grown​ to enjoy anal. The secret for her was Gabriel flicking her clit with his thumb​, taking away the pain as​ he initially pressed into her.He slowly moved his index finger​ in and out​ of her bum hole until​ it moved with ease, and then​ he pulled out and positioned himself between her legs. Gabriel lined​ up the tip​ of his cock, the ribbed surface glistening with lubrication. Even with the lube and the finger, the fit looked tight.​ He pressed forward slowly, feeling the resistance​ as​ he guided himself into the snug opening. Andrea gripped the sheets and bit her lip​ as she felt his girth part her cheeks. The tension against his cock was unmistakable, and​ he loved​ to revel in that first push into her arse. His penis rubbed firmly against the narrow walls​ of the space, eliciting​ a deep, low groan from Andrea.He exhaled, gripping his cock tighter, adjusting his stance. The effort strained his muscles, forcing him​ to brace himself. His hand found her hip, and his fingers dug​ in for stability​ as​ he pushed further. The movement was slow​ at first, testing​ as​ he eased himself deeper into her arse.Gradually, the resistance lessened​ as Andrea relaxed. The motion became smoother, the tightness yielding​ as​ he worked​ in and out. Each thrust met with​ a soft, rhythmic groan from Andrea, whose head was buried into the pillow. The faster​ he moved, the easier​ it became, his confidence growing with every stroke.Gabriel shifted his weight and angled his cock downward, pushing her hips towards the mattress. His hands cupped her breasts, his fingers brushing over her hard nipples,​ a spark​ of electricity arcing through his fingertips.​ He pinched and rolled the sensitive buds, his pace quickening, and Andrea moaned into the sheets.His thrusts became firmer, his shaft rubbing against the narrow walls.​ He could feel the tension building within him, his stomach tightening, his breath catching​ in his chest. Each movement seemed​ to pull him closer, the pleasure radiating from his core, spreading through his limbs.Andrea snuck her hand between her legs and cupped the balls banging against her. Her other hand snaked down and rubbed her clit, the sensation almost too much. Her hips bucked, and her muscles tightened, another orgasm rushing forward with sudden force.Andrea’s pussy spasmed, and her bum tightened around Gabriel’s cock. His thrusts turned erratic, his body desperate for release.​ He felt his cock swell, the pressure building until​ he could​ no longer hold back. With​ a deep, guttural grunt,​ he slammed his cock into her, burying​ it deep, his muscles convulsing​ as his orgasm crashed over him.Gabriel gently pulled his cock out​ of Andrea’s bum.​ He looked down​ at her, and​ a huge smile spread across his face​ as​ he saw Andrea’s well fucked arse tightly holding​ in his cum.​ As she looked​ at him, she delicately and deliberately released her sphincter muscles, coaxing the thick, white spunk out​ of her rectum.​ As she felt​ it dribble out, she tightened her muscles before rereleasing them, letting his seed pulse from her tight opening​ in​ a teasing rhythm.​ It oozed out​ in​ a languid stream, clinging​ to the flesh around her arse before dribbling down her smooth pale legs. She watched, holding her breath,​ as each warm drop slid lower.Gabriel stood up, his heart pounding and his skin tingling, the rush still coursing through him.​ He grabbed​ a cloth and gently cleaned Andrea, his motions slow and tender. Then, with​ a soft sigh,​ he pulled her​ to him, her back pressed against his chest, his arms wrapping around her waist.“I can’t believe​ we just did that​ in​ a parking lot,” Andrea said, still excited.“Me neither,” Gabriel teased, nibbling her ear.With​ a lingering kiss​ on her shoulder,​ he pulled away, dressing swiftly and running​ a hand through his hair.With playful disapproval, he snatched the lube bottle and said, “Now we have to figure out how to get this paid for.”**********Still glowing from their escapade, Andrea let the last​ of her clothes slip away and shrugged into​ a robe, loosely tying​ it​ at her waist. As Gabriel stepped into the driver’s seat, Andrea padded​ to the front, settling beside him, one bare thigh peeking through the parted fabric.As the motorhome rumbled back onto the road, she shifted, allowing the robe​ to slip just enough​ to reveal more—just​ a glimpse, then another. Her foot nudged his leg, her fingers trailed idly over her knee, drawing his gaze.Gabriel exhaled sharply, gripping the wheel tighter, his knuckles white.Andrea smirked, her voice​ a low purr. “We never did get anything for lunch… shall​ we pull over?”
