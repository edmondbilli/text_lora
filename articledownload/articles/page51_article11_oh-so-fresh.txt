We are in our 60s and oh-so-very blessed. More than four decades of marriage!A few years ago, some friends told us about their bidet experience and how it changed their lives in such a good way. So we took the plunge and purchased one—not a stand-alone fixture, but one that is mounted to your toilet. A 30-minute install was all it took. It’s unbelievable how great these work.Ladies, you’ll love it. You’re always fresh. We use face cloths for drying and the laundry chute is right there.Guys, it power washes your butt. You can be fresh, too. Lol.We now have three of them. They’re about $60 on Amazon.Does anyone else enjoy the freshness of using a bidet? Does it give you more confidence when you get frisky or encourage any new explorations? Do tell!
