My dear wife Melody is having major back surgery tomorrow (or today since it’s after midnight.)  She has had bad lower back pain for years, but lately, it has become almost unbearable much of the time.That hasn’t stopped us from having some great sex sessions leading up to her surgery tomorrow. We had “doctor/sexologist and client” roleplay sex two days ago, and this morning, we did her second “office visit.” It was so amazing! Roleplay sex was a good distraction from the pain. I am writing those experiences up for MH.I am so grateful to the Lord for giving me this kind, beautiful, and sexy wife to be my companion-wife-lover! Please pray for her that her surgery will go smoothly and actually work to solve her back pain.We truly believe in the power of prayer so we want as many as possible of our friends and family praying for my wife. Y’all are our MarriageHeat friends.
