I keep seeing an ad on Pinterest for pheromone perfumes.I was wondering if any of you gals (or guys) have ever tried it around your spouse?  Does it really get the instantly-attracted reaction shown in the videos? I’m curious.If it does work, maybe I would try it out just to see if guys act any differently around me.Please let me know what you think. Thanks in advance.
