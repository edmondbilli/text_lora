Hi, MH family! I have heard a bit about men receiving pleasure fromprostate stimulation, and I’d like to learn more. Some have said it’s the male G-spot. Do any of you couples experiment with this? How do you do it? If I ever get married, I’d like to have a basic knowledge about it so I can perhaps pleasure my husband. Thanks for any information!
