[UPDATE: Since my poetry is not exactly popular with many readers on MH… I am adding this true story about what actually happened today, on the morning of New Year’s Eve.]Since my wife Melodie’s and my deal is that I receive oral sex/ fellatio on holidays and special occasions, we “celebrated” New Year’s this morning!  Before our showers, I turned on our Christmas tree lights.  The tree is in our bedroom this year for the first time.We got up, walked the dog, showered, and then met nude on the bed.  The Christmas tree’s multicolored lights were on, and I had also turned on our halite lamps.  As always, my wife was a true beauty to me. Her curvy form and porcelain skin still makes my heart leap.  My penis began rising, too, as we kissed and touched.I added coconut oil and Creamsicle-flavored Aloe Cadabra to her already moist pussy, and I spent some time stroking her clitty while sucking her titty. Then I handed her our wand vibe and went back to loving on her nipples – as she buzzed her clitoris.  Occasionally I would move up to do the tongue dance while kissing – but then I focused right back on her cute nipples.“My turn!” she insisted after a few very pleasurable minutes.  The fact is, SHE loves stimulating my man nips as much as I enjoy her womanly nipples.So I rolled onto my back, and SHE loved on my man nipples as we took turns pumping my rod.  Then she slid down, and the party REALLY began as she started her oral ministrations on my hard erection!That feels wonderful!” I said as she ran her closed lips up and down my very sensitive tip.  Then she engulfed most of my length and began bobbing her hand in earnest as one hand simultaneously pumped my shaft with her thumb and forefinger.  But she paused the private sex party because of pain in her back.  (She’s having back surgery soon.)I reassured her that I loved her and it was  OK.  Then I stood up by her side of the bed, and she sat on the edge.  She engulfed my full length over and over as she bobbed forward & back.  To say it felt good would be a vast understatement!In less than 30 seconds of this, her latest brilliant technique, I advised her that I was about to come.  I came IN her mouth seven days ago on Christmas Eve, so this time, she pulled back and lifted her voluptuous boobs with one arm under them as her hand resumed pumping me.I had an enormous orgasm and sprayed her from neck to knees with my man cream.  Then she did something that was kind of new. She used both hands to rub my semen all over the front of her body –  including all around her beautiful breasts and into her perfect pussy.Then she laid down and invited me to minister to her boobies.  What a treat in more ways than one.  Some of the residues from the Cream Sickel lube had gotten mixed in as she had swiped her pussy with her cum-covered hands.  So I first licked off some cream-sickle cum from her full & shapely breasts then her nipples became my favorite treat.She went to work on her pussy with a bullet vibrator as my mouth kept busy on her titty.  Everything we’d done had her so wired, and when she’s that aroused, she is especially beautiful!  She went to her orgasmic peak in record time—20 seconds! By then, I was sucking her right nip vigorously. I could feel her back arch as she sighed and gasped when the waves of pleasure hit her and rocked her beautiful body!Rhetorically, I asked when I paused my titty-sucking for a second, “Are you cumming?”“Yes!!!” she said rather loudly in her husky sex voice.Afterward, we cuddled and kissed and rejoiced in yet another amazing immersion into the lake of married passion!The below poem was written earlier on in this holiday season.  When I found out it was to be published on New Year’s Day, I added a couple of stanzas.Not Another Long LM Poem(LovingMan’s voice)As MH readers lay in bedWith the rest of the long year aheadTo their shock, they did seeA poem written by me(MH reader’s voice)“Not another LM poem!” they said“It’s probably about his wifeWho’s sexy and the joy of his lifeShould I read it?” they think.“It will probably stinkWith weird rhymeslike ‘drum & fife’”“He’ll say she’s unfailingly kindAnd she has a very sharp mindHe’ll praise her beautySay she’s a real cutieAnd her Nordic eyes are quite sublime”“He’ll specifically mention his dickImplying it’s long and it’s thickSay her boobs are the bestWith a round curvy chestAnd his member she monthly will lick”“He’ll talk about sucking her titsAnd how he likes that quite a bitAnd her sucking his cockWhile he’s hard as a rockI’m not sure if it’s worth the fit…”“…that I throw when I finally read itBut up in my bed, I  will sitAnd as I start to readI begin to concedeThat it’s funny—at least a bit.”“They will try several sex positionsDepending onhealth conditionsIt’s an organ recitalBut I think that I willGive a tryto their sexy traditions.”“They’ll do doggy and their ‘X’ positionTheir favorite sex-time traditionsAnd she’ll buzz her clittyWhile he sucks her tittyAnd try newtechniques or additions.”“Tom & Melodie’s love willshine throughWith my spouse, itmakes me want to doSome of their sexy thingsMy queen and her kingInspired to trysomething new.”(LovingMan’s voice)So, to all who read this, I sayWhether atnight or in the dayThat in poems, I tellOf male and femaleHope you’ll laugh; be inspired by our waysThis won’t win a Pulitzer PrizeOf course, that’s no big surpriseI write for the fun ofAnd to tell everyone ofSex enduringin marital tiesWe’ve been married for 30 yearsFull of great joy and some tearsAnd the sex is still greatBetween me and my mateWe still are each other’s dears(By the way:)“Organ recital” comes from a jokeSeniors gather andmake fun and pokeIt’s an organ recitalAs we talk about allOur health problemsover a CokeI hope that you enjoyed this poemIt probably caused you to groanThey are so fun to writeUsually late at nightWhen insomnia makes my mind roamI don’t put them all onM-HeatTo do so would be a real featBut their ratings are lowYet SOME like them, soFor a few of you, they are a treatFor those readers who do really hate themNone of you have sought to berate themMany just will not read ’emAnd some will not heed ’emAnd of course, some will lowly rate themI still think my rhymes are quite cleverThough clearly, they’re not the best everBut I find my poems fun‘Bout unique things we’ve doneThough some of you will read them neverAbout sex positions, I’ll sayWe do missionary on some daysAnd sometimes do cowgirlAnd others, given a whirlThere are so many ways to playShe gives BJs on each holidayIt’s her special-occasion forayHer blow jobs are so greatA ten plus do they rateAn incredible show ofamoreAnd since it is now New Year’s DayFellatio fun’s on the waySomething to celebrateWith my cute loving mateAnd that is important to sayI’m finding it hard to stop writingAs different adventures,I’m citingSo I’ll quit while aheadAnd just go to bed‘Cause it’s sleep that Iseem to be fighting(After reading thisto Melodie, I will add:)My wife says my poetry’s painfulShe gives me a look that is banefulBut I keep writing moreThough to some, they’re a boreI’ve probably written a train fullSo Happy New Year, MH friendsThanks for your patience with poems I’ve pennedKeep loving your spouseMay your fire not be dousedThis is the wish that I send(Poem is over.  Now about that joke that I mentioned:Question:  What do you call a gathering of us elderly people talking about their health issues?Answer:  An organ recital!)
