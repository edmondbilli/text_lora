There is an online article titled,Stop Calling Your Wife Hot.It’s in the title. It opens…“’If I hear one more Christian guy call his wife hot (every time he talks about her), I’m going to throw a plate at the wall.’ I suggested that he actually throw the plate at the guy calling his wife hot, or “smokin’ hot” for that matter (tongue in cheek, of course). Maybe it would knock some sense and normalcy into them.”This is the basic attitude throughout. It asserts calling your wife hot to other people is awkward—that agreeing with the person would be really weird—basically, that such public statements make people uneasy. They feel they can’t disagree, and ignoring is rude. They’re put in the position of having to figure out, “Do you really want us trying to determine if your wife is, in fact, hot?”They author asserts that calling attention to her hotness doesn’t honor her. Rather, it creates an opportunity for others to judge. It makes her a standard of beauty for others—something we really shouldn’t want to do, because others may agree, or disagree, possibly in public.It also says it objectifies her, by talking this way, possibly causing others to do so too.The article tells us it is good for people to know you are attracted to her and want only her, but corrects a person to keep the hotness talk inside the walls of your home. They say it is only between you and her, and that this kind of public talk is no good for anyone.Is this correct? Should such talk be kept to ourselves? If so, why? If not, why not? What do you think? Does anything specific come to mind? What is your reaction? Agree? Disagree? Or, maybe this brings up another point you wish to make.Women, wives, men, husbands, would you write an article like this, or would you say something else? What is your reply to this writer?I will share my thoughts with any other replies, once this posts. Thanks for reading & responding.Christ is all & in all.
