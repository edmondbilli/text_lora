Thank you, MH!I wrote aboutOpening Up About Masturbationback in 2022. To recap: I have been married for years, I do masturbate regularly, but was struggling with guilt and shame and never opened up about this to my dear wife. Well, not until now that is.Thanks to all the comments and suggestions that followed my story, I finally mustered up my courage and talked to my princess. It was probably one of the most stressful conversations in my life, but it turned out wonderfully. She was not at all condemning or disappointed. In fact, she said she was happy that I took care of myself. And… she admitted to masturbation herself! It turns out my dear Christian wife has been masturbating regularly for years just like I have.That conversation was so refreshing, so relieving and calming. Now I no longer feel bad about hiding an important aspect of my life from her. And it has brought us even closer. We have also incorporated masturbation into our sex life. We have lots of kinds of fun, games, etc. We use it as foreplay. We roleplay being naughty, getting caught, and so on. And when my wife cannot or does not want to have sex, she will sometimes say: “Go, have some private fun time,” and kiss me.Overall, I cannot stress enough how our marriage has improved. I wish I had discussed masturbation earlier with her.And thank you all. You are a blessing.
