I got the idea a while back to focus on each love language individually within the confines of the bedroom. Tonight I planned to use one of Dr. Daddy’s best-received love languages: Words of Affirmation. I was excited because I think this particular love language lends itself to easily seducing your lover’s mind and to deep, emotional lovemaking.Obviously, the key is to never lie and to only offer genuine praise. Fortunately, there ought to be many things you love about your spouse. And the wonderful thing is that, as you focus on what you love instead of the things that irritate you, you’ll start to see even more praiseworthy attributes. At least, that’s been my experience.Without a doubt I have said passionate, praising things to him before during sex. However, tonight would be the result of forethought and precise planning. Tonight would be more like a recited love letter than off-the-cuff general praise.We were in our bedroom, alone except for the dog (this is my real life, after all) with the bed turned down, and only the bedside lamp lit, casting the room in a soft glow.“I know you must be tired. All the hard work you do is clearly evident: your job, JR’s extra-curricular activities, volunteering at church.” I reached up and ran my fingers lightly across his brow and down his neck. “But do you feel like playing a little tonight?”“I always want to play with you,” he whispered as he stepped in to kiss me.“Mmmm good! I’ve been thinking about you all day, and it’s made me so THIRSTY!” I said with a grin while I ran my hands down his shirt. Grabbing the hem, I pulled the undershirt over his head, kissing every inch of warm skin as it was revealed. I lightly brushed the pads of my thumbs across his hardened nipples, causing him to suck in a breath and tighten his abs at the sensation. I purred contentedly as I trailed my fingertips softly over his collarbone, shoulders, and biceps.“The work you’ve been doing around the house really shows. Flex for me.”He rolled his eyes but flexed his biceps as I asked.“You are so strong,” I whispered. A hint of a smile ghosted his lips, and his eyes were full of adoration.My hands found the waistband of his boxers, and I lowered to my knees as I tugged them down.Running my palms up the inside of his legs, I made eye contact with him as I knelt on the floor.“Seeing you naked always turns me on. I love to look at you.”And then I looked—really looked—at his body and took it all in. I gazed at him like the masterpiece he is and took the time to visually enjoy what God made for me. I let my hands slowly skim up to his glorious cock, but I teased past it and up to his abdomen.He gathered me close and kissed my mouth with increased passion, unbuttoning the front of my sheer black nightshirt. The way he kissed me drove me crazy, kisses so soft he was almost only breathing on my neck.“Sweet mercy,” I said as he breathes butterfly kisses from my neck to my ears. “You’re making my breasts feel so heavy.”His hands slide up my side and lift a breast in each hand. His mouth dips to a nipple and, at first, he gives me nothing but butterfly kisses there as well causing me to squirm with need. He treats the other nipple to the same torture before mercifully sucking me into his mouth.“Yes!” I gasp and I hold his head to my breast.He expertly rolls and flicks my nipple with his tongue and I moan.He slips my panties over my hips letting them drop to the floor then cups my heat with his hand. I can feel the excitement hum through my body. The sound of our heavy breathing creates an erotic atmosphere. Dr. Daddy stretches out on the bed and I crawl to him. I kiss his neck and swirl my tongue across his nipples before I straddle him. Breathy kisses tend to tickle him so I try to be rougher as I nibble my way down his body.I swirl the flat of my tongue around his balls then dip lower, underneath them, licking up and over. I suck each one gently into my mouth and cover it with my tongue. Cupping them in my hand, I use little teasing licks and kisses up the shaft of his dick.“I love how hard you get for me,” I whisper.I run the flat of my tongue from the base to the tip several times. On the last pass, I swirl my tongue around the tip. His cock pulses. I grip him firmly at the base and place my soft lips on the head of his dick. I let his hard body part my lips and glide into my hot mouth. He rides over my tongue while I pump him with my hand. His breathing catches. I can taste his tempting pre-cum as it drips from him like a dam about to break. I give him one long, hard suck from root to tip and release him with a pop.“You always taste delicious! Sucking your cock is one of my favorite things to do.”His gaze is hazy. He watches me drunkenly as I straddle his hips.“You’re making me so wet,” I say, as a I rub my needy clit against the underside of his hard cock. “Do you feel it? Can you feel how wet your dick makes me? How hard you make my clit?” I ask. I grind against him a little longer, teasing us both, before lifting up and taking him slowly into me. Ahhh … that first feeling of fullness is like no other. It causes a tingling at the base of my skull, simmering heat under my skin, and a sense of rightness.I lift and lower.“You feel amazing…” I breathe, stroking his face as I love him.I lift and lower.“You are more than I ever hoped for.” Our gazes lock.I lift and lower.“…ever dreamed of…”Lift and lower.“You are so smart…”Lift and lower.“…and thoughtful…”Lift and lower.“…and kind…”Lift and lower.“And. An. Amazing. Lover.”Lift and lower.“I’m proud to be your wife.”Dr. Daddy is gripping me tighter and thrusting into me harder with each pump until he finally flips us over. I’m curved up in a “C” shape, legs spread, while he drives into me hitting the front wall of my pussy and causing me to see stars.“Yes, yes, yes.” I chant unable to string together sentences any longer.My skin is flushed and I’m glistening with sweat. I feel so full as his cock strokes my g-spot with every pump. I start to coil tighter and tighter.The muscles in his arms bunch. The cords in his neck stand out. He locks his jaw and grunts with each thrust.His fingers settle on my lower stomach and he presses his thumb to my clit.He swipes his thumb back and forth across my clit while he presses firmly with his fingers above my pubic bone. I’m cumming. The rush of pleasure shoots up and down my body. My pussy squeezes his cock so tightly I’m amazed that my body doesn’t force him out. I call out his name and wrap my arms and legs around him.The rhythmic grip of my pussy carries him over the edge. He groans in relief and his hot cum fills me. He falls panting onto me and I lightly run my fingernails up and down his back. We hold each other as our breathing slows. The awe and love I see when our eyes lock is humbling and makes my heart soar.“I love you,” I whisper.“I love you, too,” he rumbles as he kisses me softly.
