Three years ago, my husband and I came across this website. Going in. we didn’t know what it was, but after reading, we joined. It’s rare to find a website or space dedicated to married Christian couples or Christian singles who love Christ. I remember sharing our first time, our very first story here. Anywhere else, we would’ve been shamed, even by other Christians. Here, we were met with blessings and support. My husband and I love it here. MH isn’t only Christian in name but in actions too. We’re grateful we found a place of godly love and support. We’ve learned so much here, especially from other married Christian couples or those waiting for their spouse. It feels good to know other people follow God’s teachings and are willing to share gifts God created in a godly way.I remember feeling ashamed for moaning, making noise, not knowing things, and for not having an O. After reading all the comments, stories, and support, I no longer feel shame. In fact, my relationship with Christ and my husband deepened. I actually had my very first O thanks to MH. My husband and I experiment thanks to everyone here. Who knew sex could be so much more fun?!Currently, my husband and I are trying to create new life, God willing. It’s so much fun reading here and trying new things, especially the pregnancy stories. I can’t wait to share mine.  We both get aroused reading here. It’s actually crazy how wet I get, lol. We can easily read here and, afterward, make love. We can’t wait to announce our pregnancy to all of you. MH is like family to us.For now, my husband and I will continue having fun and reconnecting as spouses. We’ll continue sharing and reading so we can share more and have more sex! Actually, we’re going to the bedroom right after reading another hot story. My poor husband is ready, and so am I, but we had to post this.Thank you, MH. We love you. Thank you for creating this space for us to enjoy. God Bless.
