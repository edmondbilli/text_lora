As I approach 50, I wanted to share a few words of wisdom. My husband passed a few years ago, and I miss him dearly. We had 30 yrs of marriage and 4 wonderful forever-family children. We were unable to have biological children, but that didn’t stop us from having a wonderful family.Early in our marriage, my husband and I set aside one week a year just for the two of us. Now that time has passed, I understand the importance of having an anniversary. It was usually near our anniversary we spent the week together, just the two of us, to enjoy the bond God gave us.This week we basically devoted to having fun together like we were in our 20s again. This is very important in a loving relationship. Just one week a year to let go, be immature and enjoy each other. It’s important to have this more than once a year, but at a minimum, take one week just for the two of you.I remember one such week a few years ago when we almost didn’t go during COVID; we really consider just a staycation. But at the last moment, we found a good deal at a resort that had all the proper safety policies in place.I usually don’t drink, but that week we decided to let go and just be like the “rebellious” 20-year-old college kids we were when we first meet. We basically locked ourselves in our room and just had sex all week. We really opened up about our likes and dislikes, being honest with each other. By the end of the week, we had grown together sexually, spiritually, and physically, learning about our changing bodies.I know this is not the best sex story, but I just needed to share. It’s important to share yourself, divulge your fantasies, and open up as one with your spouse before they’re gone. Have a wonderfully blessed week, everyone. Open up with your spouse and face the troubles of this world as one.
