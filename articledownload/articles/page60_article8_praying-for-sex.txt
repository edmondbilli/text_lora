As a way to work on our communication skills, my wife and I will randomly discuss topics each of us brings to the table. Recently, I came up with a question that stumped us both, so I figured I would bring it to MH for the readersâ€™ opinions.My question is this: Would it be wrong to pray for specific sex acts? I know the Bible says pray about everything, but is that type of prayer asking God too much??I look forward to reading your opinions in the comments.
