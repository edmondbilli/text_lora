Hello, all.I recently discovered that I have a fetish for hairiness. I asked my wife to grow her underarm hair because it pushes my sex drive sky-high. I believe the driving concept is that I want to enjoy a mature woman, not feel child-like skin. I also tell her to let her pubic hair grow, and I do the same. I enjoy being naked and hairy with her.My question: Is this usual? It seems from many stories here that the norm is to be bare or at least trimmed down below. Underarm hair isnâ€™t often mentioned, so I wonder if I am an outlier on this issue. Many thanks for your input.
