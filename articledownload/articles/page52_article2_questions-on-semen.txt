I am very curious as to the opinions that the gals on the site have toward cum and if there is any change in views over the years through experience and exposure.When it comes to semen, would you say about yourself currently:I enjoy the taste of cum.I enjoy the feel of cum on my body or face.I do not enjoy the taste of cum, but I will do it for my husband.I do not enjoy the feel of cum on my body or face, but I will allow it for my husband.I only allow my husband to cum inside me or elsewhere but not on me.Other.How about before you experienced your husbandâ€™s semen?The thought of cum disgusted me.The thought of cum intrigued me.I had no expectations or thoughts of semen before my husband.Other.Would love personal comments on this.And guys, please chime in and tell us about how you viewed ejaculation and what you prefer and why!
