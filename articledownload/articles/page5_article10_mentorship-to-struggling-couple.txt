We’ve been long time readers and have always enjoyed the content and discussions on here. We’ve been married for well over a decade and continue to enjoy a great sex life. Multiple times a week we enjoy the fruits of our marriage, and believe the frequency has led to openness which in turn has led to improved sex and intimacy over the years. We want to share that gift so other couples can benefit.Flip this around, and we have friends who are struggling with intimacy. They have been married for years, and for a mix of reasons (mismatched libido, struggling to find their sex groove, etc.), they do not have a consistently good sex life, and it is taking a toll on their marriage. They seem tired, distant with each other, and invisible. He seems sexually frustrated with her, and she seems to have forgotten the beauty of married intimacy.We have tried to discuss how to have better sex, because we believe as it improves, so does the frequency, which creates a continuous loop of desire, frequency, and thereby contentment. They have been receptive and listened, but we aren’t sure they have solved their challenges.We have discussed helping them have better sex, but aren’t sure how open to be and how much mentorship we should give. We aren’t shy with them. We share tips and tricks. But we want to hear from those who have experienced similar circumstances. How have you helped other married couples who have struggled getting their sex lives going in a good direction?How explicit would you be in giving sex advice or help for married Christian friends when couples shyness or awkwardness isn’t an issue? How have you helped friends in need in the past? Would it cross the lines to help coach and demonstrate for them and help them (with their married partner)? Any tips on handling this?
