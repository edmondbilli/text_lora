This question or questions go out to the wives of MH.My wife and I are from the “old school” generation, and were married in the late “70s”. This was a time when ladies were “au naturel” when it came to the pubic region, and wore a full bush down there. Over many years of marriage, my wife still maintains that bushy area, though somewhat trimmed. I find this to be very sexy. There’s nothing like sliding my hand down her panties and feeling and running my fingers though that tuft of bush. Hence my curiosity and questions:How many of you ladies keep a full thick bush, or partially trimmed pubic area?How many of you have gone the way of complete hairless/smoothness?How many of you prefer your man to be “manscaped” versus having a full growth of pubic hair?Thanks in advance.
