The 30-Day Sex Challenge is something I’ve been keen on trying for years now, but my wife felt a bit daunted.  However, after listening to a podcast where they discussed the challenge, she decided she was ready to give it a go.  As you’ll see, I documented a few days more than just 30, but we had a string going leading up to June, so we decided just to include them too!  Besides attempting to have sex every day, the only other guideline we put in place was if sex was not an option (due to certain times of the month), touching ourselves would be the go-to, but we had to be together when we did it.  Below are my notes from every day of the challenge.Day One (05/28)- Had morning sex.  It was amazing.Day Two (05/29):Had a tiff after some friends of ours’ wedding.  Talked about it very calmly and civilly almost immediately afterward.  God really has been working.  We had absolutely incredible sex after our conversation.  It started slow and then exploded.  We tried some new things, too, which was amazing.Day Three (05/30): Had sex in the evening.  Nothing crazy.  It was nice.Day Four (05/31):This was the first day we didn’t really feel like making love.  We were both tired.Morganwas comfy in bed, and I had been working on school, but we talked and encouraged each other to stick with it.  We laughed and joked.  Hearing her laugh makes me feel so much better, even if things are already great.  Lovemaking started slow, and we began to enjoy it.  We climaxed together after a few minutes.  Our orgasms were surprisingly strong.  Afterward, we lay there in each other’s arms and talked, laughed, and snuggled before I headed back to do school.  It was really nice.  The first time since starting that I felt like, even though we both didn’t want to start, it ended up being something that brought us close and, actually far more important than the sex, allowed us to stop, slow down, and carve out time for each other.  It was really pleasant and fun just to sit there and talk and laugh with Morgan.  I look forward to more nights like this.Day Five (06/01):Looked forward to sex all day.  Unlike last night, we both had the energy for it.  Much like last night, this served as an opportunity for us to talk, laugh, and spend time together.  Sex itself was wonderful as well; we even tried a new position.  It was awkward and made it extremely clear I need to work out, but it was still nice to try something new!  We also played a game of Marco Polo in the dark.  It was a good time.Day Six (06/02):Really didn’t feel like doing it tonight, which led to us goofing around before hand more than usual.  It was nice.  We did have sex, and that was nice too!Day Seven (06/03):Well!  We faltered today and didn’t do anything.  I was very grumpy this evening for reasons I didn’t need to be.  This caused a lack of connection amongst us all night.  Finally, at about 11:30 P.M., after we both woke from a nap in our spots on the couch, Morgan pushed me to talk.  I didn’t want too, but as usual, she knew I needed it more than I did, and I felt much better afterward.  We both felt closerto one another and better by the end of it.  We decided to hold off on sex, as it was late and we were tired, but we spent time joking and watching TikTok together.  I’m bummed that we missed a day so early on, but I believe God still used this challenge to help us talk where we might not have.  Still a good night.Day 8 (06/04):We woke up late Saturday morning and snuggled in bed for a bit.Morganstarted her period, so as agreed, we masturbated instead of having sex.  We snuggled up side by side while doing it, and Morgan laid her head on my shoulder.  It was sweet and intimate.Day 9 (06/05):Poor Morgan wasn’t feeling well this evening, so we postponed stuff tonight as well.Day 10 (06/06): Wow… I am one lucky man.Morganwas feeling better today, and while penetration still wasn’t on the menu, she suggested we dress up and roleplay.  She dressed up as my suburban housewife, and I, her trophy husband.  She wore a skirt with nothing underneath, a cute button-up top with no sleeves, and no bra.  She touched herself at my command, and after I got hard, I unzipped my pants and let her pull me out.  We pulled her breasts out, and she took me in her mouth.  When it came time to finish, she sat back and pleasured herself as I finished all over her breasts that she had pulled free of her top for me to finish on.  We both came together.  It’s fun to be able to do this together.  I can’t believe I’m married to a woman like this.  Smart, intelligent, creative, and a freak in the sheets.  UPDATE-We did it one more time before bed, as my bride wanted another go.  She is astounding.Day 11 (06/07): We skipped today as the missus was not feeling well.  Tomorrow it is!Day 12 (06/08):Morganstill wasn’t feeling 100%, but she insisted we have sex this evening.  We took our time and went very slowly.  It was actually a nice change of pace.  It allowed us to slow down and really feel what was going on with our own bodies and each other’s.  Then we lay there and hung out together for a little bit before I scooted back to the computer to do school.Day 13 (06/09):So, no sex tonight, but we did watch each other Jack and Jill in the shower, and that was just as fun!  I think my favorite part about this challenge so far is not just how it’s made us mix things up but just how much laughter we’ve been blessed with!  It feels like every night we’ve gone to do something, we’ve been blessed with some of the most genuine laughter we’ve had together in some time.Day 14 (06/10): Did a bend-over-the-bathroom-sink-before-a-shower quickie this evening.  Nothing wild, but still really nice.Day 15 (06/11):It was a cruddy and stressful day today.  All we really wanted to do was stay at home and do nothing, but family obligations beckoned.  We were both exhausted by the time we got home, but we made time to get a session in, doing doggy style.  It was very needed by both of us.  After that, we spent the night naked, sitting in the living room.  I played games and surfed the internet, and Morgan watched T.V. It was a wonderful end to a stressful day.Day 16 (06/12):Missed today, unfortunately.  I worked on school until late in the night, and the wife fell asleep.  Maybe if we do it twice tomorrow, it’ll make up for it?Day 17 (06/13):Back to it this evening, and what a return to form!  No quickies or exhaustion this evening.  We actually had/made time to enjoy each other this evening.  I started by going down on her, then chose a position where I could watch her breasts bounce around.  I am married to the prettiest darn woman.  I definitely married way up.Day 18 (06/14):I love still being able to make my bride laugh.  Hearing her laugh uncontrollably is like feeling the warmth of sunlight after coming out of a cold room.  Sex was also banging.Day 19 (06/15):Missed tonight, too… oops!However, whenclimbing into bed after working on school all evening, we lay next to each other for half an hour and laughed, talked, and enjoyed one another as we fell asleep.  It was a fair trade.Day 20 (06/16):Nice night.  We did a position where I could watch my bride’s breasts bounce around.  She was having trouble finishing, so we switched to a position where I held her arms above her head…. That did the trick 😉Day 21 (06/17):Did it quite late (technically, more like 1:30 in the morning on Saturday, but this is our challenge, and I’m counting it as Friday, lol).Morganhad a family friend over, and she ended up sleeping on our couch.Morganand I did it in the other room and made sure to stay quiet.  It’s always fun.Day 22 (06/18):Missed today… we’re bad at this, lol.Day 23 (06/19):Morning sex to start our Sunday.  I think morning sex might be my favorite time to have sex…or at least tied with “it’s been a bit, and we’re both ready to tear each other’s clothes off” sex.Day 24 (06/20):Took a break from doing school work for my beautiful partner to bend over our desk while I did her from behind.  It was incredible, one of those moments during sex where I realized how wildly blessed I am to be married to who I’m married too.  Not many a wife would remind her husband to stop doing school so that he could give her the business!  Dunno how I got so lucky.Day 25 (06/21):Came into the bedroom this evening to find my bride fast asleep; she woke up, though, and insisted we do the deed.  We did, it was awesome, and I’m blessed to be married to someone so committed.Day 26 (06/22):My bride suggested we do it outside today!  We live out in the country, and while we have neighbors, they’re spread out and blocked by trees, so no one could make us out.  She bent over the railing on our deck while I entered her from behind, and it was wonderful.  The weather was beautiful, the sun shone, the trees looked beautiful, and my wife looked gorgeous.  It gets me going to be married to such a kinky and inventive woman.  She still finds ways to shock me in the best ways!🙂Day 27 (06/23):Morgan surprised me with a blowjob this evening!  We had talked about doing oral to mix things up, but then while I was on the phone, she sprung it on me!  I told her to wait, and she gave me this devilish little look, shook her head no, and away she went!  It took awhile, but I finally finished, and it was amazing.  Lots of laughs in between the start and stop too, which I enjoyed more than the blowjob.Day 28 (06/24):So, we missed this evening, but I’m giving us a pass on this one.  Work took us to a ball game tonight, so we were out late.  By the time we got home, it was late, and we were tired, hot, and ready for bed!Day 29 (06/25):A brilliant day.  Morgan planned a day for us to go to the city and have dinner at a very nice steak restaurant for my birthday (which is Thursday, but we’re celebrating early.)She knows how much I love getting dressed up and going to nice places with her, so she knew I’d love it.  There is something about getting all dressed up and going out with her that I just adore.  Not to mention that I get to see my wife in her fancies.  She is normally a blue jeans and a band t-shirt kind of gal (which is hot), but my God, when she decides to dress up, she is the prettiest woman you’ve ever seen.  She wore a really pretty one-piece dress that pulled up above her breasts, and she let her beautiful hair down (which looked extra nice tonight as we both got haircuts earlier this morning.)She looked awesome, and I couldn’t wait to pull that dress down around her ankles later 😉  Dinner was a blast.  We’d never been to such a nice place before; she did a great job picking the place out.  After steak, we split an awesome chocolate cake, then headed to a game/comic shop and got some stuff.  I can’t believe my bride is as much into this stuff as I am, and I count my blessings every day because of it.As for sex, we used the restraints on the bed this evening, and it was phenomenal.  We started out slowly kissing, with me thanking Morgan for putting in such effort for the day.  Then I had her get on her knees and strapped her arms in.  I kissed her neck and slowly pulled her dress down, freeing her amazing breasts; feeling them graze against my hands in the process got me going.  I pulled the dress down to her ankles and spanked her, then reached down the front of her red thong and went to work.  Then I unstrapped her long enough to put her on her back, strapped her arms back down, and immediately and aggressively went down her.  Her moans of pleasure told me I was going in the right direction, so I picked up the pace, letting her know how much I loved what is between her legs.  She came quite hard, her thighs squeezing my head, with the words “stop, stop” escaping like a faint whisper.Still dressed in my fancies, I unzipped the front of my pants and took myself out, much to her delight.  Then I pulled her knees up to her gorgeous breasts and plunged inside her, pumping so hard my legs burned.  “Pineapple is the safe word; I’m not stopping otherwise,” I inform her.“Please don’t stop at all,” she said.We both reached climax not long after that, finishing aggressively as we stared passionately and intensely into each other’s eyes.  I fell onto Morgan’schest and undid the straps.  She wrapped her arms tightly around me as I reached underneath her to grab her butt, and we kissed deeply and passionately.  We lay there a moment before getting up and cleaning ourselves.  We then headed to the living room to play video games.  An incredible day, an incredible partner, an astounding God.Day 30 (06/26):Nothing too wild this evening.  Had sex.  It was fantastic.Day 31 (06/27):My beautiful bride was on fire this evening.  After Morgan told me during the day that she’d been thinking about me all morning, we were both excited for sex.  We went to church that evening, and while she was driving us home, she leaned over to start stroking me.  I was so surprised and yet so willing.  We got home, got naked, and she climbed on top of me and rode me.  There are not many things I enjoy more than watching my bride ride me.  She finished once, then we finished together, and it was intense.Day 31 (06/28):We did a quickie after dinner and before our shower (my amazing wife’s idea.) We stripped down, she bent over the couch, and I went in her from behind.  I LOVE the feel of my wife’s butt against me, so needless to say, it was awesome.  My wife is so beautiful, and that position allows me to see her curves.Day 32 (06/29):Did it right after we both got home from work and before our shower.  We were both hot, sweaty, and gross, and it did nothing but add to how awesome it was.  We started out in doggy until Morgan finished, then she lay on her stomach with me on top.  After going with that for a bit, we took a short breather as I wasn’t getting there.  We talked about what we wanted to do, then went with some light bondage (just me holding her arms above her head) and some light choking.  That was just enough to get us both there.  I’m thankful we trust each other enough to branch out to do stuff like this.  I am always astonished by the connection God has created between us.  I felt a bit kinky tonight and didn’t say anything, and so was Morgan.  And yet, it was like we both felt it in the air.  God is so cool.Day 33 (06/30):We made it!  Last official day of the challenge.  I was feeling some stress and pressure today because of school, which made things a bit hard for me to finish.  Poor Morgan always feels so bad and self-conscious when this happens, even though it isn’t her fault.  She was feeling a bit self-conscious about her body also, which always pains me to see as she is so pretty and wonderful.  It’s one of those things that, though I can build her up and tell her positive things, I can’t make go away, and it’s hard as a husband to see her struggling with something.  We did eventually get there, though!  Sometimes when I’m feeling stressed and pressured about something, my body has some difficulties relaxing, so some time laying there and talking with my bride, mixed with her getting on top so I can watch her beautiful self do her thing, is always the fix!Conclusion:  This was indeed a challenge but a massively enjoyable one.  I found the benefits of it to be much, much different than what I thought it would be going in.  I imagined it would bring about a new form of romantic intimacy, but it didn’t.  I suppose because Morgan and I had a very good sex life before the challenge, I didn’t see that form of intimacy flourish.  In fact, the entire time we did the challenge, I believe there were only 2-3 times (if that) that we had one of those lovemaking sessions that boiled over with passion.  There was that passionate connection you feel with your spouse when doing an act like that, but most times, on the romantic passion level, I never noticed a big spike.However, I did notice that we laughed together SO much more!  It’s not like we didn’t laugh with each other before this, but, oh my goodness!  It seemed like a whole new level of appreciation for each other’s humor bloomed because of this.  Whether having sex or not, it was like we laughed together in ways I’m not sure we’ve experienced since we first met.This challenge also made a big difference in our lives by making us spend quality time together, despite how busy we’ve been.  I work full-time and am a full-time student.  And then, of course, you have the natural distractions, pressures, and responsibilities of life outside of those things.  Typically, we would shower together after work and eat dinner.  Then I would handle the remaining duties for the day with us chatting a small amount on and off throughout the night, and I’d come to bed after my bride had fallen asleep.  Now, we intentionally took 30 minutes to an hour every night to spend time together, regardless of whether we felt we had the time or energy for it.  As anybody who has been married for a particular amount of time can attest, there are times the passion for sex just isn’t there.  When you get into it, it’s incredible, and you’re glad you decided to do it!  But you don’t always feel like putting forth the effort, and there are times when it isn’t this peak of passion.  Sometimes it’s “I’m sweaty, dirty, and tired from work; she is tired, has her hair in a messy bun, and both of us have things we’re trying to get done.  So let’s just pull our pants down, do this together quick, clean up, and do what we’ve got to do.” And I’ve come to find these moments as deeply intimate, in their own way.I found, along with laughing so much more together in every way, that we could joke around and give each other crap without one of us getting butthurt.  I found that when we argued, we resolved things MUCH faster.  I found we came to a deeper appreciation of one another.  I also didn’t have to worry about my wife thinking I wanted sex just because I said something sweet to her or stopped in the kitchen to plant a kiss on her neck.  We were already gonna have sex, so they were received as gentle signs of love and appreciation, and I felt I could give them more freely without fear they would be received as signs of initiation instead of me speaking her love language.This challenge took work and effort, but the kind of work and effort that make it worthwhile.  So much so that this is something we want to try and keep going!  The deepening of our friendship made this challenge amazing, and a few days out from finishing it up, I’ve found it’s spiked our sex drive something fierce.  Right after we finished the challenge, we went two days without doing anything—and were both ravenously horny.  Even this morning, after having sex yesterday, all either of us can think of is tearing each other’s clothes off tonight.  This is a challenge I think everyone can benefit from.  Aim for every day, but give yourselves some grace if it doesn’t happen.  Enjoy the journey, and see where it takes you!
