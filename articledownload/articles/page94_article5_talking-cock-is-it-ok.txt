I’m a younger, single guy, waiting and searching for my future wife.In the meantime, I’m horny — thanks to my natural sex drive and God-given urge for release. This site has been such a wonderful outlet for my solo time, stroking my cock and emptying my (often full and heavy) balls. There are so many sexy and beautiful couples (and like-minded singles) here.So here’s my question… What are your thoughts on a guy having another guy friend with whom he talks about his cock as well as sex with his respective future wife? I believe that camaraderie from sharing in the joys of our dicks and desires can be healthy.Please share your thoughts with me!
