As an adjunct to today’s story,Weekly Spanking and Anal Maintenance, we’d like to open a discussion about whether Christians can rightfully enjoy bondage, discipline or domination, sadism or submission, and/or masochism (BDSM) as part of their sex life.For the record, we recognize that there are healthy and unhealthy dynamics that can be labeled BDSM. Most practitioners and advocates define a healthy dynamic as one that is safe, sane, and consensual. For our publication purposes, we add the stipulation that the interactions exhibit a loving attitude.We think it’s important to clarify that in a safe BDSM interaction, it is the submissive who controls the action while their spouse assumes a dominant character for their mutual pleasure. It is a form of roleplay. The dom (or top) should always be attentive to the sub (or bottom) and, when a previously agreed upon “stop” signal is given, will bring the “scene” to an immediate close and proceed to aftercare.There is a book written by theMH author known as Silveron this subject. It’s called Guide to Marriage Kink (first chapter here) and was published on Amazon but is currently only available on the used book market.So what about you, MHers? Do you—or do you want to—incorporate BDSM into your sex lives? If so, why and how does it fit or conflict with your Christian ideals? If not, what are your objections?
