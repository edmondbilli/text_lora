I want to pass on a suggestion my wife and I recently enjoyed: a homemade comic book!There are many apps that convert your pictures into cartoon or comic-style images and also provide comic book layouts. So my wife and I chose to create some original sex superheroes. We created costumes and chose names and everything. Then we created a plot together and took lots of pictures illustrating that plot! After some simple editing and cropping, we had our very own comic book!If you like roleplaying but are intimidated by acting, I heavily recommend trying it!
