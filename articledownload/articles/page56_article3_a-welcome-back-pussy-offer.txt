I recently came back from a work engagement. All week, I could only video call my wife and baby. My wife looked gorgeous, and I could hardly wait to jump on that flight back. The moment I reached home, I looked at her and knew she was ready for me. After sharing gifts and stories, we put our baby to sleep and hit the sheets.She was horny and just wanted her man. She grabbed me, I lay on top of her, and she wrapped me in her warm body embrace. Her thighs were so smooth, and her boobs were pressing against my chest. We were eye to eye, and my cock pressed urgently on her Yoyo. Even now, it is still such a great memory!Soon she commanded me to start rubbing her clit. We are in a season where we don’t want to conceive another child right away. So we make love raw with me rubbing on the outside until we both cum. I grabbed my hard long cock and rubbed it on her dripping folds. Soon she was lost in ecstasy.“GO FAAAAST,” she roared, and I increased my pace. She came hard and clenched her fists as she shook like an earthquake.I stayed focused amidst the temptations of thrusting into her pussy and remembered our discipline. I groaned as I felt a wave sweep through me. Holding my dick, I pulsed rope after rope of cum. In the throes of orgasm, I wished it could have gone deep into her cunt so that we’d have another baby.She embraced me as I came back to normal. That was a good welcome! In a special way, sex is like therapy for a married couple. I encourage us all not to have any excuses why we should not enjoy this part of our relationship.Soon we will be celebrating an anniversary, and we look forward to more romance, thrills, and escapades. As men, let’s keep loving our wives and making their toes curl in many climaxes and joyful moans. That happiness was created by God and is intended for marriage alone. So keep the romance going.
