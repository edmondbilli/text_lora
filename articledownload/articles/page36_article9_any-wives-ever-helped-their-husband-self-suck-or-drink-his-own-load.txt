Ladies, this question is regarding if you’ve ever helped your husband suck himself and/or drink his own cum?Have you ever tried this with your hubby?Did he asked to do it?Did you have the curiosity to see what his reaction would be?I have tried to suck myself many times but can only get a few inches from my face.  Honestly, I suspect most guys have tried at least once during their life.As for trying my load, I figured a long time ago if I want her to like it, I should be willing to.  After all, our manly essence is just as pure and honorable as our lovely bride’s.Would love to hear your thoughts on this.  Husbands, feel free to chime in as well.Thanks in advance.
