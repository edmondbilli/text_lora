Once in a while, as I am waking up, the beginnings of a sexy song parody cum to mind. (Pun intended.)  The beginnings of this song parody happened to be there in my mind this morning.  We had been working on recovery from our third round of COVID-19, and it was getting truly annoying for both of us.  We were on the upswing but not yet fully well.  I think I wrote this song parody to cheer up my wife.  She had been sicker than I had been. The lyrics came to me quickly since my wife’s moniker on MH is Melody.  My MH authorship name is LovingMan, and that worked well too. The song parody was inspired by many very real sexy things we do.  But mostly, I hope it gives you a good laugh. WE thought it was funny.“Loving Man”Sung to the tune of “Piano Man” or read as a poem:Verse 1:It’s nine o’clock on a SaturdayWe both have been as sick as sinMy beautiful wife’s lying next to meMaking love to her’s what I wanna be doin’She says Tom can you play meI’m your Melody(I want her from her head to her toes)Your man touches are sweetAnd you make me feel completeSo I want you to remove all my clothesRefrain:She says Make love to meYou’re my loving manMake love to me tonight‘Cause you know that I am your MelodyAnd I want you to play me all nightVerse 2:Melody was once a friend of mineBut I grew to love her, and she grew to love meShe likes all my jokesWe like each other’s folksBut she’d like to much healthier beShe says, Tom this dang COVID’s been bugging meAs the smile runs away from her faceAnd I wish that you were making love to meI say, Inside you’s my favorite placeRefrain:I say, We’ll get through thisI’m your Loving ManWe’re gonna get through this alrightCause you are my beautiful MelodyAnd this isn’t a permanent plightVerse 3:Now we were once busy scientistsBut we found time to be husband and wifeLovemaking’s been gravyWe go sexually crazyAnd we hope to do so for lifeAnd I’d love us to be practicing oral sexAnd then her pussy I’d boneAnd then I would give her cunnilingusAnd lick out our protein-rich foamVerse 4:I say, I’m so proud of you this SaturdayShe gives me a beautiful smileand says, It’s my nude body you’re longing to seeSo we can forget about our health for a whileAnd I know that we’re gonna have a real ballWhen the COVID gets outta here‘Cause we’re each other’s starand we’re gonna go farSo we cuddle, and I hold her nearRefrainMake love to me you’re my Loving ManMake love to me tonight‘Cause you know that I am your MelodyAnd I want you to play me all nightRefrainI’ll make love to you, I’m you’re Loving ManI’ll make love to you tonight‘Cause I know that you are my MelodyAnd I wanna play you all nightJust so ya know… We DID make love the next day – in the morning, actually.
