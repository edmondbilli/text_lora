Oh, yeah. That’s the look.Annabelle stood in front of the full-length mirror in their bedroom, admiring the view she was about to seduce her husband with. It was two days after she had come up with the idea, and she was putting it into action tonight.**********A Personal Greeting and Re-Introduction**********Hi MH brothers and sisters, and happy new year!I’ve been an active member of the community for many years and commented on many stories and discussions, but I’ve only made a few posts of my own, and none in the last several years. Life has kept me busy with things, both good and bad, all according to God’s plan. Now that I’ve finally finished a story again, I thought it would be a good time to re-introduce myself!I’m a mid-twenties single man who, by the grace of God and through the amazing community of MarriageHeat, has developed a passion for the staggering beauty of sexual intimacy and adventure within marriage. MarriageHeat provides such a wonderful service, and it has been a huge blessing to me. It has been such valuable resource for shaping my views on sex in a way that is biblical, God-centered and hot, hot,hotat the same time. In fact, I’m so passionate about MarriageHeat’s mission that back in July, I joined the team as an editor! (Who ever knew I’d use my literary gifts to write and edit erotica on the internet? Not me! And certainly not my church homeschool co-op writing teachers! LOL!)I’m happy to say that the name PatientPassion still rings true for me, all these years after I chose it. Though I’m a little disappointed tostillbe waiting for that one special woman to bond with, and though the lack of intimate companionship is sometimes heavy and painful, I’m still grateful to God for all the immense work he has done in my life. I know that because of the great work of preparation God has done in me, when the time for Patience ends, the Passion will be utterly explosive.That’s what I want to write about: the explosive passion I hope to cultivate and experience in my future marriage, for the mutual pleasure of myself and my cherished future bride.Before the story, I have a few things to explain, if you’re interested. If not, feel free to skip to the action!Gideon and Annabelle are fictional stand-ins for myself and my future wife. I use these two characters to bring to life the hopes, dreams, desires and fantasies I have for our future sexual relationship. They’re not expectations, exactly, just thoughts of how it might look, and descriptions of an ideal I want the two of us to strive for.My ongoing single years have given me plenty of time to dream up and marinate in steamy ideas for future sexual interactions. That meanslotsof ideas for stories! (I probably have nearly 200 different ideas, outlines, and drafts that I could turn into full stories, if I only had the time!)This time I decided to look at the story through the woman’s eyes. If my male perspective doesn’t capture female thoughts in a believable way, I’d be happy to take feedback from female readers in the comments to reeducate me on how women actually think, so that I can understand and love my future wife better! 🙂I’m also connecting this story with the MarriageHeat Writers’ Corner post that’s being published today, to serve as a reference and example for the writing tips given in that post. So if you see strange-looking references like [WC Example 13], that’s why!Now, without further ado…**********Atta Girl – Part 1**********Annabelle was frustrated. [WC Example 3]Although,she reasoned to herself,at least it’s a good thing to be frustrated about.[WC Example 8]The truth was, she was content. Happy. Frankly, blessed more than she ever would have dared to hope for. She had hoped for a good husband, and God had sent a truly amazing one in Gideon.He was by no means perfect, of course. But he was strong of character, true of moral compass, kind, dedicated, steady, and wise beyond his years. He loved her deeply and holistically. He was a wonderful companion.And a wonderful lover. [WC Example 3]Oh yes, his love definitely included a ravenous sexual desire for her. But it wasn’t out of place or disproportionate. Their sex life was firmly rooted in a healthy, holistic relationship, so their sexual intimacy was beautiful and powerful without being the only meaningful part of their relationship.So, what was the problem? Annabelle wasn’t sure how to love him back as well as he loved her. It wasn’t a transactional feeling of indebtedness. She just recognized Gideon’s daily blessings of love to her and was inspired to bless him back. She wanted to be the best possible wife for him.The few times she’d mentioned it, he always said not to worry about it, that she was an awesome wife. He never complained about her either.But even though they’d achieved a healthy, happy status quo in their relationship, she still felt something was missing, and she wanted to somehow do more for him.The thought bothered her for weeks. She asked her friends and mentors if they had ideas. She prayed about it. She spent extra time reading the Bible and sought its wisdom on how to be an excellent wife.She got good answers, but nothing quite satisfied that question that kept burning in her mind:How do I show him how deeply and passionately I love him?The answer finally came shortly after she did. [WC Example 2]**********Annabelle basked in the warm, fuzzy bliss of afterglow one night, cuddled skin to skin with her soulmate. Gideon held her from behind, his arm wrapped around her middle, gently pulling her naked body into his. She relaxed into him, soaking in his love, and silently sent a prayer of gratitude for this man she adored—this man who adored her.She felt a vague but distinct impression of a prompting question.Shush, don’t think, just enjoy this,she thought to herself. But the impression was persistent. Rather than fight it and ruin the moment, she let the thought process.There’s something about… this, our intimacy, that is telling me something. But, what?Her thoughts drifted through their just-finished encounter, recalling every intoxicating detail.She remembered his soft but insistent kisses as she got ready for bed.She remembered the obvious desire in his voice and body language.She remembered the swelling of his manhood, which always felt so perfect in her hand… her mouth… her hot and hungry pussy.She remembered him stripping off her nightgown, pushing her to the bed, and covering her whole body in kisses, driving her wild with arousal and making her feel like the most cherished woman in the world.She remembered the masculine grunts and feminine cries of pleasure that filled their bedroom as he mounted her and prodded every erogenous spot on her body, inside and out, giving her no choice but to quake in ecstasy under the weight of his naked body pressing hers down.She remembered him moaning her name and “I love you,” which intensified as he climaxed inside her, then became ever so tender and gentle as they both found release and relaxation.Those whispered “I love you”s still echoed in her ears from mere minutes ago. Gideon would often say that many times while they made love and afterwards, and she never got tired of it. It made her giddy inside.I love how he tells me he loves me—how he pursues me, how he pleasures me and enjoys my pleasure… it makes me feel so desired and loved. Alone, it might make me feel devalued and objectified, but built on top of our healthy relationship, it takes our love and sends it so much higher. Being pursued like that makes me feel so deeply and passionately loved! Oh, I wish I knew how to do that for him…It clicked. [WC Example 3]It was painfully obvious now that she realized it.If I want him to feel loved and desired like he makes me feel… should I just take the initiative to pursue him sexually?She had prayed even more than usual this morning about her question of how to love her husband well. This seemed to be answer to that prayer. And, it might have been her imagination, but the answer almost seemed to come with the impression of an “Atta girl” of approval. “Atta girl” didn’t sound like a very… Holy Spirit-like thing to say, but… well, she wasn’t going to complain. The idea was an answer to prayer—and an exciting one at that.Now, how do I actually do this?She’d initiated sex before, on occasion. She didn’t mind doing so. In fact, it was pretty fun. The only problem was that this ravenous horn-dog of a man almost always beat her to it.As much as she loved his advances, she would have to work extra hard to make it obvious to him thatshewas the one pursuinghim. [WC Example 7]As she lay skin to skin with her mate, an idea began to formulate, and a grin crept across her lips.She was going to rock. His. World. [WC Example 2]**********Oh, yeah. That’s the look.Annabelle stood in front of the full-length mirror in their bedroom, admiring the view she was about to seduce her husband with. It was two days after she had come up with the idea, and she was putting it into action tonight.She wore an unbuttoned, red flannel overshirt, hanging open and tied in a knot at the bottom, revealing her midsection and a lacy, black, half-cup bra. It showed so much of her breasts, it was scandalously close to letting her nipples show. She wasn’t a big-chested girl, but the bra helped create some tantalizing cleavage. Annabelle was content with her endowment, even if they were slightly smaller than average—whatever “average” was anyway. [WC Example 10] And Gideon seemed absolutely infatuated with them, so that was reason enough for her to be happy with them.The half-cup bra was matched by skimpy, lacy, black panties, worn undervery[WC Example 7] short denim shorts. If Annabelle bent the wrong way, the bottom of her cheeks would start hanging out! This pair was closer to lingerie than proper clothing, so she only ever wore these in private—mostly for Gideon’s benefit. She knew he was wild for her ass, and these did wonders to highlight it.She added her cowgirl hat to the ensemble, and, looking in the mirror, she had to admit it looked good. It looked great, actually. That cowgirl in the mirror was smoking hot, and Annabelle knew she would have Gideon all over her in seconds looking like that. (Note for readers: the featured image is a good approximation of her outfit.)She smirked a bit as she found herself checking out the hot country girl she saw in the mirror.I’m sorry, Gideon,she thought, not at all actually sorry.There’s no way you’ll be able to resist. Poor baby. You’ll just have to accept that you’re going to be my plaything for the night.But after considering the look with and without the hat, she decided to leave it off. Yes, it was hot, but it made the outfit start to look too much like a slutty Halloween costume. Too overdone. Still sexy, but almost goofy. But without the hat, the rest of the outfit looked alluringly casual, effortlessly seductive. In a sense, it said coyly, “I’m nottryingto seduce you, I just want to be comfortable. But if Idoend up seducing you by ‘accident,’ well… that’s a pleasant side effect, now, isn’t it?”With one last check, a grin, and a small nod of approval, Annabelle left the bedroom to start preparing dinner. [WC Example 1]Gideon sometimes had the convenience of working from home, but he had been out that day, which provided her with this opportunity to prepare this sexy surprise for him.The anticipation of her seductive plan fueled her. Wearing such a downright sexy outfit made her feel hot and put her whole body, mind and heart in a state of simmering arousal before Gideon even got home.For the next half-hour, her thoughts bounced between food and sex. Well, if she was honest, it was more constantly thinking about sex while occasionally remembering to get back to cooking.Will he be able to resist, or will he just take me right when he sees me? Will I be able to hold back and make him wait? Or will I just give in and demand he take me right then? What if we just forget the food, and he puts me on the table and eats my pussy for dinner instead?Her pussy creamed a little at that thought.No. This is going to be a slow seduction, and I’m going to be the one in control. We’re going to absolutely ravish each other, but not until I say. No dessert until after dinner.[WC Example 4]Before she knew it, she heard a car in the driveway. Annabelle felt her heart started beating faster, and excitement buzzed in her body.He would be inside any second. She felt the yearning to let go, run to him and melt into him.No. I’m in control tonight. HE is going to be the one melting tonight.The door opened, and Annabelle sashayed over with a seductive smile.“Hey Belle! …Oh… What—” Gideon’s eyes darted up and down in surprise, instinctively drinking in the intoxicating sight before him.Annabelle felt a thrill of satisfaction, knowing he was hooked, and more importantly, knowing that he truly thought she was hot. She stalked right up to him and kissed him without a word, making it as sensual as she knew how. She heard him—andfelthim—moan into her mouth, which she read as part surprise and part pleasure. She smiled a little against his lips, satisfied with that reaction.As she pulled back from the kiss, she put a finger to his lips, not letting him get even a single word in. She gazed up into his eyes. After that, she didn’t have to try to look sultry—it was effortless. He gazed back at her, transfixed.“Dinner first,” she whispered sensually. She glanced down and acknowledged her breasts nearly spilling out of her shirt and bra. She met his eyes again and added in a voice dripping with innuendo, “…Then dessert.”She smiled at him mischievously, then turned around and walked back into the kitchen. She intentionally put a little extra swing in her hips to show off her ass for him. She didn’t have to look back to know where his eyes were.She reached the kitchen island and looked back at him. He still stood right where she’d left him, dumbfounded.Poor man, I’ve scrambled his brain.He really was adorable when he was so obviously captivated. That happened often.Annabelle got back to the final preparations for dinner, acting as if nothing had happened. “So how was your day?” she asked casually.“It wasss… okay,” Gideon started slowly. It obviously was taking his brain a moment to re-engage after the sex bomb she’d dropped on him. “It went pretty well most of the day. Then it unexpectedly got a whole lot better right at the end.” [WC Example 9]“Oh? And what made it so much better?”He usually took his computer bag straight back to the spare bedroom he used as a home office. But this time he pointedly left it by the couch in the adjoining living room and followed her over to the kitchen island.“Well, it was actually after I was finished for the day. I met this gorgeous young lady…” He looked her in the eye knowingly. “And don’t tell anybody, but—” He cut off and glanced over his shoulder with comic exaggeration, as if looking to make sure no one else was around to hear, then leaned toward her over the island and said conspiratorially, “I think she likes me. I barely said a word to her and she just kissed me! She wassucha good kisser too.”“She was, was she?” Annabelle played along. She looked at him coyly out of the corner of her eye and said, “I wonder what else she might be able to do with that mouth?”Gideon didn’t break eye contact with her. He didn’t say another word. He just slowly rounded the island toward her.Annabelle’s heart raced. He had the look of a hunter in his eyes.No. I’m the hunter tonight!So she set an ambush.She let him stalk her. She let his smoldering gaze bore into her as he slowly leaned in to kiss her. And then just before their lips met…She forced her tongue into his mouth, grabbed his waist and pushed him back against the counter. Then she put her hands around his head so he couldn’t escape. He clearly didn’t want to escape, though. He returned her kiss with another moan and just as much ferocity as she showed him.She felt his hands wander down and start caressing her ass through her shorts. She allowed herself one sensual moan of enjoyment at his touch, then forced herself to pull out of the kiss and give him a disapproving look.“Don’t you remember what I said not two minutes ago?” [WC Example 5], [WC Example 6]“It’s so hard to remember anything but your perfect lips…”He always says such silly, lovely things.She slapped at one of his hands on her butt, and he obediently removed them.“Dinner first. It’ll be ready in a few minutes. Go shower,” she said as authoritatively as she could manage, and nodded her head toward the bathroom for emphasis. She eyed him desirously as she added, “I want you clean and ready for what comes next.”He glanced down at her barely-contained breasts, clearly wanting more of her. But she’d made it clear he would not miss out on dessert tonight.“Yes, ma’am,” he said with a smile, then hastily picked up his computer bag and headed down the hall.Annabelle let out a heavy breath. Dinner hadn’t even started, and she was already feeling like she could mount him right this moment! Was she even going to be able to wait until after dinner?At this rate, by the time we’re done, I’m going to have soaked through my shorts! That’s kinda hot though, and I bet he’s going to love it.After a few minutes, Gideon returned from the shower. Annabelle heard him coming, but didn’t expect him to bee-line for her! She should have known better.He wrapped his arms around her in a hug from behind, his hands resting just underneath her breasts, lightly caressing them through the bra.She felt his gentle fingers graze her stiff nipples through the thin fabric and moaned a little at his touch, savoring it for just a moment, letting him know she approved… then she slapped his hands away again playfully. “What did I tell you about dessert before dinner?”Gideon pouted playfully, “You’re the little seductress who put dessert in plain view without letting me have it.”“And you’re the naughty boy who can’t keep his hands to himself. You can look, but I expect you to behave yourself.Isay when it’s time for dessert. Understood?”Gideon eyed her with a smoldering gaze and said with a quiet, even intensity: “You’re pushing your luck, naughty girl.”Ohhhh my…That desirous intensity he got in his voice made her insides absolutely melt. It made her pussy feel like it was melting too, with how much heat and wetness it was making down there.It took every last bit of willpower she had to not jump him right there.“Just a little further,” she said. “You know it will be worth it if you can control yourself.”To becontinued in Part 2.
