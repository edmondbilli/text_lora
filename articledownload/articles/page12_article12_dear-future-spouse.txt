This post isn’t quite a discussion post, but neither is it a sexy story. It’s more of an self-introduction and inspiration for those spouses-in-waiting among our readership. It could stir up fond memories among those of us who are already building/maintaining our marriage heat, who may offer to add some encouragement in the comments.Hello, I’ve just discovered MH about recently, some time in October.It’s wonderfully liberating to see marriage talked about so freely and vulnerably here. I’ve since had a feeling that, if my future spouse is anything like me, he probably has already discovered this site as well—orwilldiscover it.After reading some of the stories here, I’ve become more motivated to prepare myself till I meet my man.Yet for that reason I also felt prompted to write this following letter.I’ve received skeptic feedback when shared elsewhere.Given the context and MH community, I believe it will resonate better here and hope other singles find courage on their journey as well.—————————————Dear Future Spouse,Hello my love.I know it’s been a long wait, and I thank you for your courage, fortitude and patience, yet I would also like to apologise. I have an inkling that it wasn’t the smoothest journey to sail through, for you or for me, yet I hope you’ve been well.In my thirty-seven laps around the sun as an Asian-Canadian with a very colourful nomadic family history, I’ve travelled to places wondering if you were in these different cities, yet I’ve never quite felt this way before.I thank God for taking me into his embrace, baptising me even predating my earliest memories as a child, and through my journey with Him, I’ve come to experience many unbelievable spiritual encounters and gifts. As such, I do believe I am able to differentiate between what I feel physically, emotionally and spiritually.So when I say I’ve never quite felt like this before, know that it doesn’t happen often. By this phrase, I mean that I think I can sense your prayers for me or your thoughts. It’s hard to explain.Since October 2024, I’ve felt oddly enveloped in this warm, sweet and loving spiritual embrace that makes me feel like I’m married, even though I’m very, very, very single.I’ve only felt this way once in a dream I had when I was 16.Next was a dream/vision some time around 2017-2020, and in this dream, you very clearly said to me, “No matter what, I’ll wait for you.” I woke up crying from that dream, because of the situation I was in at the time.It’s been quite a few years since then. It must not have been easy for you.So, I’d just like to say, “I’m so sorry, baby. Thank you, and I love you already.”At the same time, I know God has perfect timing. For whatever reason, like a beautifully long dance, I’d like to believe we’ve been simultaneously preparing and working on ourselves, yet spiritually have always been partners from the start. It’s just that (at least on my end) self-doubt has perhaps dragged on longer than it needed to. Now I know I need not follow the train of thought that tells me, “I’m still single because there’s something wrong with me.” To that, I say, “No.”For many years, I hadn’t felt anything. I wasn’t able to believe that there was a person for me.I felt alone and strange, not fitting into this bizarrely tainted modern world of relationships. Yet after reading stories on MH, it’s made marriage feel very attainable and grounded in reality. I’ve also come to realise it is a matter of faith and action. The quicker I take action on myself to prepare for my divine husband, the sooner we will meet in the flesh. The closer my relationship is with God, the more faith I have, the more I get to understand how I was made and who I am, discover the truths of myself and face down any inner demons, the sooner we will meet in the flesh.I still have quite a bit to work on, and perhaps we each still have preconceived ideas of what we imagine our spouse to be like. I pray, and want to tell you, I’m pretty amazing ’cause God made me to be, but I’m also navigating being a human, and in that, I may not be as perfect as the version of me you have in your mind.As a single, sometimes marriage becomes a fantasy, a mirage, or we place the idea of our spouse on a pedestal, as a kind of saving grace from loneliness. Yet that’s not what it is. God is our saving grace. Holy Spirit and our angels help us feel at peace and know we’re never alone.As for our spouse? Baby, you’re my partner in life. I want to share the beautiful moments God gifts me with every day, and you’re the one I want to tell it to. (I’ve had insane miracles happen in my life, on the daily—insane.) And I wish you could tell me all about your stories too. You’re also my crime-fighting, kick-ass spiritual warrior, and I’ll be that for you. We’ll keep our souls pure and divinely aligned with God above all else.With that said, we are on MH, and we know what that means, so I’ll leave by saying I’m praying for you, and whenever the urge hits, you’re in my thoughts. And boy, you’ve been in my thoughts quite a bit this past month. The energy is tantalisingly sweet and spicy. I’m over here breathless already! 😉With blessings & love,– Your Future Spouse
