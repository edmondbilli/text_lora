My wife and I recently had our second child. Through the past year, we started developing our D/s (Dominant/submissive) relationship. Now being a four-person household, things have become much more busy. I don’t mean to come off as complaining, I do understand this is just a learning curve, but I was hoping some of you may have some advice for us, especially those who also have this dynamic within your marriage.Note from MH: Since the author didn’t give many details, here are some additional questions to jump-start the discussion:How can a busy couple find time for Dominant/submissive play?How would you advise a couple to handle boundaries between D/s play and real life, especially with young children around?What are some ways can a couple playfully remind each other of the D/s dynamic they sometimes share, even when life and children temporarily prevent overtly sexual contact?
