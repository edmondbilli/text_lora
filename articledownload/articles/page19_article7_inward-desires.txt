Hi all!My name is John and I am new here—well, newly signed up, but I have been reading some articles for a while now. I actually came here to discuss sexuality with fellow believers, as I have had many thoughts and questions, but no real outlet for those things.It is my hope that I can engage in meaningful discussion and hopefully learn from others and share my own views.What I’d like to chat about today is the inward desires we all have. Or any inward thoughts that we keep to ourselves that we’re too scared to talk about.I’m talking about things that are not permitted for us Christians to partake in, yet still turn us on when we think about them. Maybe we get off to those thoughts, or even read erotica or watch porn about them.I’m talking about things like orgies, homosexual sex, exhibitionism perhaps—I think you get the picture. I’m not trying to glorify any of these acts, please don’t misunderstand me. But I will be the first to admit that some things forbidden for us believers do turn me on, and I have orgasmed to those things. I’ve gone through the guilt and shame every time, but never had an outlet for talking about it.I think it’s worth talking about. There must be a psychology around why we’re turned on by these things.If anyone is interested in such a discussion, please reply with your innermost desires and how you’ve coped with the fantasies and any possible feelings of guilt or shame.Kindest regards,John
