I’ve had this idea rolling around in my head lately. I could use some MH community help.For some reason I’m inspired to do something creative in the bedroom based on the 5 Love Languages. Dr. Daddy and I have read the book, taken the quiz, and we share the same top two love languages: acts of service and words of affirmation.I think I’d like to individually address all five of the love languages specifically in a bedroom setting and write about each encounter. Make a series of it? Has anyone done this before?I have a pretty goodidea of what I want to do for four of the five languages. I am stuck on “gifts”, which isn’t surprising since it’s my lowest ranked language. A toy or sexy underwear seems easy and obvious. But he really isn’t a big sex toy enjoyer or a fan of anything other than his regular boxers.Any out of the box ideas on the “gifts language night” would be appreciated. Thanks!
