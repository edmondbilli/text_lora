Hi everyone, itâ€™s me again ðŸ™‚So over the years, Iâ€™ve tried edging on my own, and honestlyâ€¦ I hate it. From what Iâ€™m aware, the whole point of edging is to delay your orgasm so that you get a bigger one at the end. But every time Iâ€™ve tried it, the ending is so anticlimactic that I might as well not have bothered. Itâ€™s like blowing up a balloon and instead of a bang, the balloon deflates. Or youâ€™re holding an ice cream, about to have the first taste, only for it to fall on the floor. The anticipation is nice, but the lackluster ending certainly leaves more to be desired and can be extremely frustrating, depending on the situation.Am I doing something wrong, or is this more common than not? What tips would you give someone in my situation?Thanks in advance!
