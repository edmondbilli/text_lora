I’ve got alingeringquestion for MarriageHeat readers: What’s your opinion on female oral sex (cunnilingus)?I ask because, for me, giving my wife oral pleasure is even more erotic and stimulating than getting a blowjob. Don’t get me wrong, my wife gives amazing BJs, and I would never turn one down! But I love experiencing the ecstasy she feels when I go down on her. I love exploring her with my mouth, tongue, and hands. Bringing her there, and beyond, is truly magical.Here are just a few of the ways we like to experience it:1. “Sideways”This is often our go-to when we initiate sex in bed. Lucy lies on her back and I curl next to her, my head resting at her belly. She likes to keep her legs straight and knees together. I kiss her body up and down, teasing her nipples with my tongue. My right hand slowly fingers her clit, playing with it until it gets hard. When she lifts her butt, I reach my left hand underneath her, put my palm on her ass and slowly stroke the folds of her pussy from behind with my index finger. I kiss the length of her torso, from her neck to her breasts, down her tummy, to the inside of her thighs, which I kiss gently. Then I lick her hard clit, and kiss and suck her labia.Since I’m coming at it from the side, the angle is different and her right side usually gets more attention. But I do my best to distribute the love equally. I use my right hand to stroke her while licking, sucking, and tonguing her clit. After a few minutes of this, she’s ready to cum! I put two fingers from the hand cupping her ass deep into her pussy and bring my tongue down to join the party. My other hand is busy keeping the attention on her clit. Soon she’s on her way!2. “Stand by Me”Again, this one usually happens in bed. We set up bolster pillows at the head of the bed and drape a thick quilt over the headboard. Lucy holds on to the quilt and faces the wall, standing with one leg propped on the bolster pillows. I’m semi-reclined, leaning against the other pillows with my head between her legs, and I get a delicious view of her incredible auburn bush and juicy cunt. I love this view. Let me live to be 1,000 and I would never tire of seeing my beautiful wife’s fleshy mound, soft pink lips, and moist hole. I tease her, using my tongue sparingly until she can’t handle anymore and pushes herself roughly against my face. Then I grab her hips and eat her out like there’s no tomorrow.3. “Rear Window”Lucy can be a bit self-conscious and finds this one a little embarrassing, but when she’s willing, I find doggy-style oral extremely hot. Usually she’s in the mood for this position when she’s extremely horny. It often starts with my bending her over the arm of the couch, pushing up her skirt, pulling down her underwear, and burying my face in her ass. Sometimes she’ll crawl a little further down the cushions to rest her head, her hips raised high, and her ass and pussy on full display. I lick her folds and tongue her hole and take a few quick trips to play with her ass, too.This position often evolves into 69, and I love it for the pure intimacy it allows. It also enables me to push my entire tongue deep into her tight, wet, and warm pussy.WishlistThere are a few scenarios that we haven’t tried yet but are definitely on my bucket list. One of the biggest is the kitchen. I would love Lucy to sit on our kitchen counter, naked from the waist down. I would then kneel in front of her and direct my attention to her pleasure. If she sat by the sink, we could push the rolling island closer to prop her leg on it. This would allow me easier access. We don’t have curtains on our kitchen windows, so I know Lucy would worry the newlyweds who recently moved in next door might catch a glimpse of us. But frankly, they’ve probably got the same thing on their minds. And the idea of being watched is pretty hot, too!So what about it, readers? Care to share your own favorite oral positions?
