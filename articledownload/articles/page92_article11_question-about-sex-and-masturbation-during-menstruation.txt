Hello, MH friends! I have two questions for you ladies and couples.First, how do you manage having sex while you’re on your period? I get that some women probably don’t do it because you might not feel well and it’s messy. But I’ve noticed that I am usually pretty horny during at least part of my period, so I would probably try sex while menstruating. (I mean, if I ever get married lol!).Second, can you masturbate while on your period? How do you do it? For those of you who know me from my other posts, you may recall that my masturbating technique is almost always face-down on a towel. For me, stimulation of, and pressure on, the entire vulva seems necessary for any enjoyment. But that’s not feasible when I’m gushing blood. What would you ladies suggest?
