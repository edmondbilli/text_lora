(L) – This post contains strong language.These questions are open to everyone, but especially for females.What words do you use on a daily basis for body parts and sex?  When talking with friends, do you refer to your vagina as a pussy or cunt?  What about when talking to your mom or sisters?  Would you still use the words pussy or cunt?  Do they use the words too?  My mom and sisters all use the word pussy when referring to the vagina.  Tits, too.  Of course, “boobs” is common as well.  What about for male parts?  What do you use most often?  Cock or dick?  How many of you like the word “cunt” and use it frequently and like your husbands to use it?Now, let’s talk bedroom!  How do you talk in the bedroom?  What words do you use regularly?  What phrases?  What kinds of things do you want to hear from your hubby—things that really turn you on?  Is the “F” word common place in your bedroom?  Some women don’t like it for sex.  Others love it!  I’m the latter, for sure!  What about your mom and sisters? Do they openly use the word “fuck” when referring to sex?Sarah is very open about masturbation with her girls (👍).  On this forum, sex is fucking, for her.  Curious if you teach your daughters to refer to sex as fucking too?  It’s a sexy word, for sure!  I love when my hubby is horny and tells me that he needs to fuck me so badly! 😋Anyway, the topic is SEX WORDS (and phrases) in and out of the bedroom…and everything in between.  With hubby.  With friends.  With family.  What’s the norm with you?  With them? 🤗
