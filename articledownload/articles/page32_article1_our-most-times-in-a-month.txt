This Story addresses the story prompt:“The Most Times A married Couple has had Sex, of any kind, in one Month”.I have been married once. We are in our 44th year of marriage. I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world even though my lovely wife just marked two years in memory care. I would do it all over, again, in a heartbeat.When her Bi-Polar 1 became acute in 1991, I wondered how it might affect our physical relationship. Bi-Polar disorder, in the old days they called it Manic-Depressive, has destroyed many relationships. So, I began to keep track of our sex life in my journal. I kept track from 1991 until 2022.We had always had a very active and wonderful sex life. It pretty much continued after her diagnosis, in spite of medications required to balance her, emotionally. And they all come with various side effects. It was not always “Conjugal” sex. But my wife would also just “take care of me” and I didn’t have to ask. She gave a most satisfying hand job. Our intimacy was maintained.1992 was our sexual zenith with 90 intimate encounters and had already been married for 11 years.For those keeping score, the total between 1991 and 2022 was 1,648. I would guestimate another 700-800 during the un-cataloged first 11 years.
