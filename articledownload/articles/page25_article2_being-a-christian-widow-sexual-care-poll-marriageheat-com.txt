After that my libido slowly returned and I became aware that my arousal was increasing while watching TV programmes with sex scenes and reading books. I had discovered masturbation as a teenage girl, and although often felt guilt and shame I did it regularly until I married.  I never told my husband and never did it while I was married. I started again a few years ago when the urges returned and have been regularly masturbating since.  My friend who told me about this site has been a wonderful help and encouragement about taking away the stigma I felt and released me from guilt by explaining the biblical basis it.  However, as a widow, I have experienced the pleasures of sex with a man and masturbation, while very pleasurable and enjoyable for a variety of reasons is not quite the same.  I would really love to hear from other  Christian widows, and widowers, as to their feelings on this and how they cope with the loss of a sexual partner.
