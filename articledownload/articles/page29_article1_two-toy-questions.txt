Since I am branching out with masturbating techniques, using my vibrator as a dildo is becoming a little bit difficult, the reason being that my hand gets so tired! I would like to get something with a suction cup or some other type of base so I could experiment with riding and grinding and not have to use my hands.  But I’ve got a problem: my bedroom, which is where I do 99% of my masturbating, is carpeted, and I would assume that a suction-cup dildo would not stick to carpet.  Is there any kind of dildo that attaches to carpet or other non-hard surfaces? I know there are kinds that you can stick to a shower door/wall, and I’ll probably try that in future, but for now, I’m a “bedroom masturbator” and I need something that will work there.  Any advice?My second question is a little more personal, since I’m sure people have varying opinions on it.  As I look into dildos, I’m attracted to the ones that look like a real penis.  There’s something sexy about it, and I’d have the small satisfaction of feeling that I’m experiencing the real thing without actually experiencing the real thing.  But am I in danger of getting too accustomed to a toy? Would I be putting myself in a bad place for the day I might get married and it’s time to switch over to THE real thing? Is this an issue that anyone has struggled with? I want to proceed in every sex-related action with the intent of honoring God with my body, preparing for possible marriage, and enjoying my sexuality if I am destined to remain single.  I don’t want to invite harmful items or practices into my lifestyle.  But, being still fairly new to the sexuality-God’s-way game, I have no idea if this idea is unwise or just fine.  I can’t put into words how grateful I am for everyone here on MH.  Your stories and wisdom have helped me so much.  I look forward to the replies on this!
