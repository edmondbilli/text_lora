We had an incredibly sexy role-play vacation this past fall season. I have been working on writing it up for MH. It will probably be a series of stories. But last night, this poem came to me; it gives my wife Melodie’s perspective. Some of our most amazing and memorable lovemaking experiences have involved me writing up a roleplay story for us to act out. I read the story to my wife on our way to our vacation destination. My “Elves of the Wood” story that kicked off our very sexy 4-day role play is too long for MH, but here is a multi-limerick poem that tells some of the tale from Melodie’s point of view. (Remember that the word “flicking” replaces the other “F-word” for us.)My name as you know is MelodieMH readers probably know about meTommy tells of our funHe has really cute bunsHis role-play stories always arouse meThe sexiest things that I have ever readBefore Tommy takes me nude to our bedAre his sexy roleplaysHot sex goes on for daysActing it out ‘til we’re nearly deadNewest role play was Elves of the WoodAnd things really worked out very goodFour days we were flickingMy pussy he was lickingAnd yes, I blew him all that I couldWe had a very nice elven-themed roomTook sexy pictures in elven costumeMade love morning and nightAnd by afternoon lightIt was like another honeymoon“Why am I so horny?” I saidAs I grabbed him to join me on the bedBy me, he did kneelDid not know I could feelMy orgasm while giving him headIt must be the story we first did readThough at first, I did not want to heedBut the roleplay was greatMaking love with my mateAnd him filling my pussy with his seedHe surprised me with the costumes at the innI loved the forest room we were inRead the roleplay togetherDressed in capes and in leatherFor such sexy fun I do adore him
