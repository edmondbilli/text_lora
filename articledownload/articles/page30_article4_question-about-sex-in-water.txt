Some of you have told stories of having sex either in a pool or hot tub, or a natural body of water like a lake or the ocean.  What do you ladies do for lubrication? Every time I’ve tried to finger myself in the shower or bath, it’s quite painful because water doesn’t work as lube.  I’d love to hear how you manage it.  Since I have some sizzling ideas for water lovemaking with my future husband, I want to get all the tips to make it enjoyable.  Thanks in advance!
