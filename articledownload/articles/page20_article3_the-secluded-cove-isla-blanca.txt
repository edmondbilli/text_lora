She had watched the sunrise gently rise through the pine-lined cliffs of Ibiza.They had a holiday in ‘La Isla Blanca’ every year for the last ten years, and it was one of the few places where they could unwind and rest. Andrea peered through the curtains and saw Gabriel still soundly sleeping. She reached through the open window, grasped her towel, and stepped off the room’s small balcony.Her footsteps were light and eager on the pine-covered clifftop path as she descended the short walk to the cove below the hostel against the backdrop of the cicadas and crickets singing their love songs. The ‘Cala’ never failed to promise solitude and beauty. Andrea, filled with anticipation, had snuck away every morning for a refreshing swim during her holiday, fast becoming the perfect way to start her day.Andrea inhaled deeply, the crisp scent of pine filling her lungs as she descended the cliffside path. The track was rugged, and dry earth was strewn with loose rocks, so she stepped carefully as she navigated the route. The sunlight filtered through the branches above, casting dappled light along the trail while the occasional soft breeze stirred the trees, whispering through the needles. Her mind was quiet, lost in the rhythm of her footsteps, and the crackle of twigs and rocks beneath her feet provided a comforting soundtrack.The path wound through a dense covering of trees, their pine branches offering comforting shade and a profound sense of seclusion. Though the walk was only a few minutes, it felt longer, like a peaceful journey through a hidden world. No other voices or sounds from civilisation reached her here. Andrea felt entirely at one with the nature surrounding her, savouring the profound quiet.The faint scent of the sea drifted toward her, growing stronger with each step. She knew she was close to the end of the path when the trees began to thin out, the view opening up just slightly ahead. And then, as if the world had decided to reveal its secret, the path opened utterly, and the small cove appeared before her. The secluded pebble beach glimmered in the light, the waters calm and impossibly clear, reflecting shades of turquoise and emerald. Andrea smiled, already feeling the serenity that always filled her when she reached this spot.Her eyes scanned the cove, and she saw she was all alone. She dropped her sarong on one of the two sun loungers perched on the raised platform and kicked her flip-flop under the bed. She padded to the steps and lowered herself down the four-meter ladder onto the beach. The pebbles crunched under her feet as she placed her towel on a rock and walked to the water’s edge. The water lapping gently at the shore filled the otherwise quiet air.Andrea stepped into the water, letting her body acclimatise to the temperature. She took another few steps, allowing the water to lap around her thighs. The gentle breeze swept Andrea’s dark hair, raising her arms above her head to stretch out her body, revelling in the sensations. She dove into the water, her movements smooth and practised. She felt the familiar tug and pull of the waves against her as she swam towards the cove’s centre. Andrea rolled, tipping back into the water and looking at the blue sky. The waves lifted her, carrying her gently. Andrea’s body rocked softly, the motion soothing. She turned her attention to the horizon, focusing on the distant line where the sea met the sky. She breathed deeply, filling her lungs with cool sea air. After a while, she swam back towards the beach and dried herself with the towel. She looked out over the water, and the sun warmed her skin.As Andrea clambered up the little ladder, a smile crossed her face. Gabriel was lying face down on the lounger, and her sarong lay neatly placed over his torso.“Enjoy your swim?” he mumbled into the pillow.“Every morning! It’s perfect. It’s quiet, and I feel relaxed. You know, you can join me,” Andrea said as she dried herself with the towel.“Hmm, but then I would have to wake up earlier. And I need my beauty sleep,” Gabriel mumbled.“Is that what you’re doing now?”“Oui.“Andrea’s eyes trailed over the broad expanse of his muscular back, the lines and curves of his well-defined shoulders. She admired the shape of his strong arms, the curve of his spine. The light breeze blew a few loose strands of hair around her face, and she smiled, her eyes crinkling in the corners.She reached out and ran her fingers over his back’s warm, sun-kissed skin, tracing the curve of his shoulder blades and the shape of his muscles. Andrea drew her fingers down Gabriel’s back, her fingertips flicking over the light material of her sarong as she pulled it off his midriff. As she picked it up, she smiled when she realised he was completely naked.Andrea leaned over him and pressed a soft kiss to his shoulder. His lips curved into a smile as her hair tickled his skin. She drew her fingers over his back, tracing the shape of his muscles, before she kissed him again, this time on the back of his neck. Her hands moved over his body, feeling the warmth of his skin under her fingertips.She leaned over him, her hair brushing his back, and kissed the side of his neck. She felt him shiver, and his smile grew wider. Her lips moved over his skin, tasting his sun-kissed skin with the tip of her tongue. She traced the line of his spine and smiled, feeling his back arch slightly in response. She ran her tongue over the back of his neck, teasing the sensitive skin.He turned his head slightly, glancing at her over his shoulder. His smile grew, and she leaned forward and pressed her lips to his. His kiss was soft and gentle, but there was an edge of hunger and need behind it. Her right hand moved along his arm, across his ribs, down his leg. As she did, her lips pressed against his back. Her hands grasped his ankles, and she parted his legs, nestling like a bird in a nest between them. She felt his muscles tense as she tickled the backs of his knees, moving up his thigh. She kissed and teased his skin before running her tongue up his spine up to his ear. Her right hand moved up his inner thigh, feeling the firm muscle underneath.He moaned softly, and she heard the sound, the desire and need behind it. His body trembled as she kissed the base of his ear, the sound sending a shiver down her spine. Her fingers caressed his skin at the very top of his inner thigh, teasing him.“Mon chou,you are a tease,” he said.Andrea laughed softly, the sound filling the quiet. “You think it safe to be here, sunbathing naked on this beach?”Gabriel lifted his head and glanced at her. “Oui,it’s only sunbathing…?” He almost made it sound like a question, as if uncertain about his statement.Her breath was warm on his neck as she kissed him again before saying, “Even if I do this?”Her hand moved under his torso and grasped the hard, erect cock under his belly.He sighed, “Yes, it is… oh, that feels good…”Andrea ran her tongue over his ear, teasing the sensitive skin before whispering, “What about this?”She slid her hand down his stiff shaft, her thumb circling the tip, stroking him.Gabriel shuddered and lifted his body so she could play. He moaned softly. “That feels wonderful.”She sucked his earlobe into her mouth before nipping the sensitive flesh with her teeth. He groaned, his breath catching in his throat.She leaned forward, her lips brushing his ear as she whispered, “What if I do this?”Her fingers curled around his shaft, and she began to stroke him slowly. Her palm was slick with precum, and she spread the moisture over his sensitive skin, teasing him. He groaned, and his hips rose to meet her.She continued to stroke him, but her hand struggled under the weight of his body, grinding against her. Andrea shifted her body, and Gabriel turned over on the sun lounger. She could see the extent of his arousal when his cock stood to attention in the sun. Returning to kneel back between his legs, she sat back and began to play with his balls, watching his body move in response.Gabriel moaned, and his breathing became shallow. His hips rose, his body trembling as she worked him, teasing him. Andrea reached for the sun cream and applied it to her hands, “I wouldn’t want you to burn,” she said with a smile.Using two hands, she curled her fingers around his cock and began to use them both along his shaft, turning them in different directions as her fingers rose up and down his shaft.Gabriel let out a low groan and his hips bucked. He thrust his cock into her hands and his breathing quickened. His head tilted back and his eyes closed, lost in the pleasure. She increased her speed and the slickness of the sun cream aided the motion. He thrust into her hands, his hips moving, his breathing growing more ragged.She squeezed his cock and quickened her pace, her palms slick with his precum and the sun cream. Her hands moved along his shaft as he groaned, his head tilted back, and his breath hitched in his throat.She kept stroking his cock, her hands working him faster, harder. He groaned and lunged into her hands, his hips rising. He was close. She felt his cock pulse, his breathing growing ragged. His hands clutched the lounger, and his body stiffened. His moaning grew louder, and Andrea looked up to see if they were still alone. She was confident in their solitude as she surveyed the rugged cove or the pine-lined cliff.She released her grip on his cock, and his hips bucked. Andrea wiggled out of her bikini, untying the top and placing it on the next bed over. Sliding down, she cocooned Gabriel’s cock between her breasts, squeezed them together, and began moving up and down slowly. Once more, Gabriel moaned loudly. She squeezed his cock tighter and slid her breasts along his shaft. He thrust his hips, and his body arched, his head tilted back. Andrea continued her movements, his cock slick between her breasts. Gabriel pressed his hips into her, his breath quickening. He groaned, and his breathing became shallow. Andrea could sense he was close. She knew she was not ready for him to cum just yet.“Pas encore, mon amour,” she said.“But I’m so close!” he stammered.“Soon, but not yet,” she said in a hushed voice.Andrea climbed up Gabriel’s firm, sun-kissed torso, straddling his arms and sitting on his chest.She lifted herself a little, ran her finger along the length of her labia, soaking her fingers in her aroma, and then placed her fingers under Gabriel’s nose.“Do you see how you have me?” she said coyly.“Oui.““You did this when you disturbed my quiet silence,” she said, trying to sound stern and annoyed.“I did?”“And what are you going to do about it?”“Anything you would like.”“I want your tongue, Gabriel,” she demanded.Gabriel smiled, “Yes,ma chérie.“She placed her hands on his chest and, using him for balance, positioned herself over his face. His tongue slipped out and stroked her lips. Andrea softly moaned as he moved his tongue through the folds of her sex. Her body tensed, and her breathing quickened as he furrowed through her sex. Gabriel licked and nibbled her lips, her taste filling his mouth. He flicked his tongue over her clit, causing her to moan loudly. Her voice echoing off the high cliff walls spurred him on as he lapped at her mound. She leaned forward, her hands gripping his chest, her fingernails digging into his skin. He continued his ministrations, teasing and flicking her clit with his tongue.“Oh, yes, just like that,” she moaned.She ground her pussy into his mouth, the feeling of his tongue on her clit making her tremble. She sat up, her breasts firm and presented to the sun like an offering. She reached back, wrapped her fingertips around his shaft, and tugged him sharply.Gabriel groaned, his hips bucking. She squeezed his shaft tightly, feeling his cock pulse.“Oui,please don’t stop,” she moaned.He continued his movements, his tongue flicking and lapping her pussy. His tongue teased her clit, causing her body to shudder and writhe.“Yes, right there. Oh, fuck!” she cried out.She rocked her hips, rubbing her sex against his face. She squeezed his shaft, and her body quivered, her breath hitching in her throat.Andrea leaned back and moved her grip to cup his balls, and as she swirled them between her digits, she let her middle finger run between his legs and rim his arse hole. Gabriel bucked, raising his bum to meet her finger. She could feel him take a deep intake of air as she rimmed his arse. She pressed a little firmer and let the tip of her finger pop into his rectum. Gabriel let out a loud groan, and his hips rose, thrusting his cock into her hands. He pushed his arse against her, forcing her finger deeper inside. She felt his body tremble and his cock pulse. She, too, was getting close to her orgasm.“Please,ma chérie,” he moaned, his voice husky.Andrea released his shaft and let her finger dip deeper into his arse.Andrea moved to turn around, scanning the tree line before reversing her direction on his cock. Facing his feet, she slipped Gabriel’s erection into her gaping pussy. One hand steadied her against his thigh while the other went back to rimming his hole. As she rose and fell on top of him, she could feel his cock filling her pussy. His hands grasped her hips, guiding her up and down. She rode him hard, her hips bucking, her body shaking. Her breath came in short, sharp bursts, and her voice was ragged.“Fuck, Gabriel, I’m so close. Make me cum,mon amour.“His hips rose, his cock pushing deep inside her. Her fingers probed his hole, and he bucked, his breath catching in his throat. He returned the compliment and let his fingers circle her arse, and when she pressed her finger deeper into his arse, he replied by pressing his into hers.“Fuck, I’m so close,” she moaned.Her breath hitched, her body tensed, and she threw her head back.“Please, please, make me cum!” she cried out.She ground her pussy into him, and her body shuddered, her voice trembling.“Make me cum, make me cum,” she whimpered.“Come for me, Andrea. I want to feel you cum,” he said, his voice thick with desire.She cried out, her voice echoing off the walls of the cove, and her body shuddered as her orgasm washed over her like the sea on the pebbles of the little cove. She screamed and sat up as she orgasmed, her finger remaining knuckle deep and pulling Gabriel into her as he pounded her from below.Her mind and body were in a state of bliss when Gabriel pushed her onto her side and fucked her harder and faster, searching for his orgasm. He pounded her, and her body shook. His hands grabbed her hips, pulling her towards him. She could feel his cock pulsing as he slammed into her, and his voice was thick with lust.“I’m going to cum,” he groaned.He moved faster in and out of her, and she felt his body tremble. She looked back, and he was watching his cock slide in and out of her wet, tight pussy.“Dans ma boucheGabriel!” she implored.She turned and opened her mouth wide, inviting him.He pulled his cock out of her pussy and rammed it into her waiting mouth. She sucked him hard, and his hips bucked. His hands grasped her hair as she sucked and jerked his cock. She could feel his cock starting to pulse, and then he shot his load into her waiting mouth.His body shook, and his voice was husky as he groaned. He came, filling her mouth. She held it in her mouth as he finished his spasm.As Gabriel looked down, Andrea opened her mouth and showed him his cum filling his mouth to the brim. With a wink, she pursed her lips and swallowed his load.Gabriel collapsed onto the lounger and smiled. Andrea curled up on his chest, and he wrapped his arm around her. She kissed his neck and sighed contentedly.“Did you enjoy your morning swim?” he asked with a smile.“Every morning should be like this,” she said softly.“That’s what I have been saying,” Gabriel said.Andrea laughed and leaned in and kissed him.“Perhaps we should get dressed before we are discovered?” Gabriel said.“Non,it’s taken me years to get you down here. I want to make sure you come back down with me again,” she said.Gabriel looked at her and knew she was not finished with him yet.“Encore!” she said, reaching down and running her fingers daintily over his limp cock.She smiled and began kissing his neck.“Mon amour,we need to go,” Gabriel said.“No, Gabriel,” she said, nodded and kissed him.Her fingers were moving softly along his cock, and she could feel him starting to grow larger as she played.Gabriel looked at the sky and thought, was there any better life than this? There were no clouds, the sun was high, the rays hot, and Andrea had started lapping at his cock. The tip of her tongue circled the tip of his helmet and peppered it with kisses and little sucks, giving long strokes with her hand.Andrea was determined and wanted his cock. She stroked him slowly and firmly, her hand moving along his shaft. Her lips moved over his helmet, her tongue teasing the sensitive skin. He groaned and pushed his hips towards her, and she sucked harder, her lips tight around his shaft. Her tongue flicked the tip of his cock, and she felt him quiver.She smiled and kept working his cock, her lips and tongue moving along his shaft. He groaned, his breath catching in his throat.She felt his cock begin to swell and his breathing quicken. She sucked harder, her hand moving faster along his shaft. He thrust his hips, his body tensing. As she sucked, her other hand moved between her legs, and she began playing with her clit once more, instantly feeling it grow hotter and wetter as she played.“Mon Dieu,Andrea,” he moaned.Andrea looked up and saw Gabriel looking around the beach and the trees, his eyes wide and searching.“Do you think we are safe?” she asked, smiling.“We are fine. I’m just making sure. I don’t want to be disturbed,” Gabriel said.Andrea nodded and moved over to the other sun lounger. She lowered herself onto all fours and pressed her fingers onto her mound, vigorously rubbing herself. She looked over her shoulder coyly at him.Gabriel moved quickly and took up position behind her, and using his knees, spread her legs further apart. She arched her back and looked back, giving him a wink.Gabriel pushed his cock towards her, and as his tip reached her vagina, her fingers batted his cock away. She looked over her shoulder again and shook her head. Gabriel realised her intent and, holding his erection, guided his tip to her arse.Andrea moaned and pushed back against him. She gripped the lounger and ground her body against his cock, burying his tip between her bum cheeks.“Baise moi!” she demanded.“Oui,I love fucking you” he obliged.Gabriel’s cock pressed against her arsehole, the tip pushing further into the tight ring. She groaned and went back, taking his shaft into her rectum.Gabriel thrust his hips, burying his shaft into her. She moaned, her body tensing, and she squeezed her muscles.Gabriel gasped and paused for a second before beginning to pump her arse, his hips moving faster, his body pressing against hers.Andrea moaned, her body shaking, her fingers still playing furiously on her clit. She could feel his balls slapping against her labia as he thrust into her, his cock pulsing inside her.She pushed her arse back, her body arching, her head thrown back, her voice rising.“Fuck me, Gabriel, fuck me,” she moaned.“Oui, oui,I love fucking your tight arse,” he groaned.She groaned, her breath catching in her throat. She clenched her muscles, and he gasped. He pushed his hips forward, his cock plunging deep into her rectum. She cried out, her body trembling, her voice raw and husky.Gabriel kept his movements going, his hips thrusting, his cock pushing deeper into her. With every plunge, her tits moved back and forth; she used her free hand to pinch and squeeze her nipple as she took Gabriel’s pounding.Her voice was ragged, and her breath came in short, sharp pants. He gripped her hips, pulling her back to him, his cock pulsing inside her. Her head tilted back, and her body tensed. She squeezed her muscles, and he gasped.“I’m going to cum. Gabriel, don’t stop!” she cried.“Oui, oui.“She fucked back as hard as she could, his cock tearing into her arse as they fucked. Her fingers circled her clit, her voice growing louder, and she cried out. She was going to cum again.“I’m cumming, Gabriel!” she cried out, her body quaking.Gabriel could feel her orgasm washing over her as she shuddered and quivered, her body shaking.He kept thrusting into her, his cock pushing deep inside her. She cried out, her voice echoing off the cliff walls, and her body shook as her orgasm washed over her.“Oui, Oui, Oui!“Gabriel was close now, and as he thrust into her, his cock swelled, and his body tensed. He gripped her hips, and with a loud groan, his body stiffened, and he orgasmed. He grunted hoarsely as his load shot into her arse.He collapsed on top of her, and she rolled over and smiled.“Merci,” she said.Gabriel leaned in and kissed her, his tongue finding hers.They lay naked together, enjoying the warm sun and the waves lapping on the shore for a while.Eventually, Andrea said she needed water, so they dressed and walked up the cliff to the hostel.“Maybe tomorrow I could do my yoga down here,” she said.“Perhaps I will join you,” he said, smiling.“Perhaps,” she said with a grin.Gabriel knew he would be there. He could not wait to watch her do her yoga on the beach.
