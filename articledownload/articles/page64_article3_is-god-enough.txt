“Never fear answers, only fear running out of questions.”Susan Ivanova,Babylon 5(I definitely don’t have that problem; far too many questions.)I saw a recent post on this year-old discussion topic ( https://marriageheat.com/2022/05/23/craving-marriage/#comment-58670 ), and it got me thinking.  I had enough thoughts that perhaps it deserves its own thread?I’ve definitely had the mindset for the last 15-20 years that God would *send* me a wife when I was ready (or whatever), and I don’t know how I feel about that mindset anymore.  I’ve had so many people tell me I “need to put myself out there,” whether in Christian or secular terms, and I also appreciate the mindset given by those that encourage a more proactive approach. Perhaps it’s time for me to start following some of this kind of advice, get out there, involve myself in groups, meet new people, attend a (larger) church that actually has single women? 😉But the other thing is that talking with an elder in my church recently, one of the questions he asked me was:“If you never marry, would God be enough for you?”I hate this question. I reacted rather vehemently against it.I would rather die than live my whole life alone!  If I am fated to die alone, it might as well be tomorrow, not in 40-50 years!Things of that sort.  And it’s easy forhimto say God alone should be enough; he’s married!  But the thing is that that question still keeps coming into my mind, and I still don’t have a satisfying answer.  I’m afraid of the answer I did give.  Am I putting marriage and sex above God or His sovereignty?  Or is this something where I need to hold God to His promises, wrestle for it like Jacob did?  There are elements in this relating to Prophecies spoken over my life, on which I’d rather not elaborate here yet—or perhaps ever.  And of course, if there is a song that perfectly depicts my attitude for the last few years, it’s Veruca Salt singing, “I Want It Now” fromWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  OK, not really, but still…But does God really havesomeone in particularpicked out for all of us (or even just some of us)?  Or are we failing to appreciate what’s around us because we’re intentionally sticking our heads in the sand?  And what does the messageWaitactually mean?  What does Waitinglook like to you?How do I wait patiently and faithfully while simultaneously accepting the possibility of it never happening?And how do I stop tying my own happiness to the expectation of fulfillment in another personand instead find fulfillment in God?  Is it even possible for me—aren’t we made male and female exactly because we need to be completed by the opposite sex?  The element of Surrendering to God in this is… difficult.Are these questions that you struggle with (or did in the past)?  Are these questions for a counselor/psychologist?  Am I not “Waiting” correctly?  Am I overthinking everything?
