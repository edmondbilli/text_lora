I am not sure if this is ok to post here, but I sure could use some advice.But first, a little bit of a backstory. I have been married for 13 years. We have been together for almost 16. When I was a month shy of 16, we first met.  We have 2 beautiful girls together and a third on the way.I have lied and cheated.  I cheated on him when we were teens and lied about it and he eventually found out.  And I lied about some of the stuff I had done with other people as a stupid teenager.  Some of those lies I kept until very recently and I also cheated on him in my mind.  There was some time when we were having sex and I couldn’t get there and I would think of other people, and random people and things and that is how I would orgasm.  I haven’t done that in years and years, but it is cheating. I have kept lies in my heart from my husband for a very long time.  They are now all out and he knows everything.He is very hurt, but the absolute best man in the whole entire world.  I feel like I don’t know how to be the Christian wife I want and need to be. The wife he deserves.  I need help and advice and please no judgement. I have been judged enough by myself, I promise you that.  My husband is the most forgiving, loving man that I could have ever asked for and I want to move on from this and I guess in a way, start a new life with him.  One free of lies and secrets.  I’m not sure how to go about being the wife that I am supposed to be.  Can any of the ladies on here please help me?
