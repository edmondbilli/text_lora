Questions for discussion: Were you always (from the moment you said “I do”) completely comfortable playing with yourself and getting yourself off in front of your spouse?  If so, when was the first time you did it?  How did it happen? What did your wife or husband say?If the answer is no, how long did it take for you to become completely open and comfortable doing yourself in front of your hubby or wife?  What changed for you?  Did it take a lot of encouragement from your significant other?  There seem to be a lot of women out there that are still too shy to even admit that they masturbate.  I’ve read stories about husbands secretly catching their wives playing with themselves even though they say they don’t do it.  I play with my pussy, and I love it and don’t care who knows!Women, does it turn you on even more to be watched? Do you get turned on watching your man stroke his cock and shoot his load?  I think both male and female masturbation is really sexy and hot, but I have a girlfriend that does not want to watch her husband jerk off even though he wants to do it in front of her. It would be and extra turn on for him, and he wants that openness/closeness.  She’s not interested in watching, however. It does nothing for her, she says. Any other women on MH that find it a turn off too?
