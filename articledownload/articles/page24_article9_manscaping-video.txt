Seems like I’m always stumbling on something that arouses me!  Today I was scrolling through YouTube and saw a video about manscaping.  I know, kind of an odd thing for my video feed.  It was pretty short and tame, just highlighting a barber who also does manscaping for his clients.  But there were a couple of spicy shots of him at work on a nude customer.He was kneeling in front of the guy, trimming his pubic area. The camera captured the nice smooth butt of the standing customer.  I’ve said before that tight male buttocks are immensely sexy to me, so it turned me on immediately.Then there was a side shot of the barber trimming the guy’s groin, though his actual package was blurred.  I have to say that that area on a man’s body just makes me hot and wet. Especially that V narrowing down to the base of his cock.My insides were clenching as I thought about someday seeing my future husband naked! I’d finally be able to look to my heart’s content. And touch and kiss and do all kinds of delightful things.  Whew!  I think I may need to go “take care” of myself after this!I imagine we’ve done manscaping surveys for the men on who’s doing it, who’s not, and why. Probably also for the ladies, do you like your man ‘scaped or not, and why. Any updates?Inquiring minds want to know. Horny minds need to know! Thanks, all!
