(L) – This story contains strong language.The sky was painted in deep strokes of amber and violet, the last light of the sun melting into the horizon as the waves lapped lazily at the shore. A warm breeze rolled in from the ocean, carrying the scent of salt and adventure, the distant murmur of laughter and conversation trailing from the beach bars lining the coast.But here, tucked away in a secluded cove just beyond the main stretch of the beach, the world felt smaller.Just them.Just the rush of the tide, the whisper of the wind, and the undeniable pull between them.She sat on his lap, her legs straddling his hips, her bare thighs warm against the rough texture of the blanket they had laid out on the sand. He leaned back on his elbows, his dark eyes heavy-lidded with something dangerous, something knowing, as he watched her.They had been flirting with the edge all evening—teasing touches, stolen glances, the kind of charged anticipation that made every moment electric. The kind of desire that burned slow and steady, waiting for the right moment to erupt.And now, with the golden glow of sunset bathing them in warm light, she decided to stop waiting.Her hands moved to his chest, fingers tracing the ridges of his abs, his muscles tightening beneath her touch. She smirked, knowing how much he wanted her, knowing how long he had been holding back.“You keep looking at me like that,” she murmured, rolling her hips against him, feeling the hard length of him pressing against her through his shorts, “and I might have to do something about it.”His jaw clenched. “You’ve been teasing me all day.”She bit her lip, leaning in, her breath warm against his. “So stop me.”He didn’t.Instead, his hands slid beneath her sundress, gripping her thighs, his fingers digging into her skin as he pulled her closer.She gasped as he shifted, rolling his hips up against her, the friction making her pulse throb with need.“I’m not stopping you,” he murmured, his lips brushing against her jaw. “I’m just making sure you know what you’re asking for.”She shivered, her hands already moving between them, undoing the button of his shorts, dragging the zipper down. He groaned softly as she freed him, her fingers wrapping around the thick, heavy length of him, feeling how hard he was for her, how much he had been holding back.She lifted herself slightly, pushing her soaked panties aside, and slowly sank down onto him.A sharp inhale slipped from her lips as he stretched her, filling her inch by inch, her body molding to his in a way that felt impossibly good. His hands gripped her hips tighter, his fingers pressing bruises into her skin as he fought to stay still, to let her set the pace.“Fuck,” he muttered, his head falling back against the blanket, his breath uneven.She rolled her hips slowly at first, savoring the way he filled her, the way he groaned beneath her, his hands tightening as he fought the urge to take control.She smirked, leaning forward, pressing her hands against his chest. “You like watching me like this, don’t you?”His dark eyes snapped to hers, his gaze smoldering. “You have no idea.”She picked up the pace, moving faster, grinding down on him in slow, deliberate circles, watching the way his jaw tensed, the way his abs flexed with every roll of her hips.The thrill of it—being out in the open, the distant sound of people passing by, the risk of getting caught—only made it hotter.She bit back a moan, her fingers digging into his chest as pleasure built higher, coiling tight in her stomach.“You’re gonna make me cum,” he groaned, his grip on her turning desperate, his breath ragged.“Hold it,” she whispered, grinding down harder, watching the way his muscles tightened beneath her.But he couldn’t.With a sharp curse, he buried himself deep, his cock pulsing inside her as he came, his jaw clenching as he groaned her name.She gasped at the feeling, at the warmth spreading inside her, her own body pulsing in response, the pleasure so close she could barely think.But she wasn’t done.Her smirk returned as she lifted herself off him, her body still trembling, her thighs slick with their combined release.He was still catching his breath when she shifted, moving up his body, straddling his face before he could even react.He groaned as she sank down onto his mouth, his hands gripping her thighs, his tongue immediately finding her clit, dragging over her soaked folds, licking up every drop of their mixed arousal.She whimpered, rolling her hips, grinding against his face, his nose pressing against her clit just right, sending sparks of pleasure through her.He groaned against her, the vibrations making her cry out as he devoured her, his tongue plunging deep, his grip tightening as he pulled her down harder.She couldn’t hold back.The pleasure built impossibly fast, overwhelming, her body tightening as the pressure coiled inside her.“Fuck—” she gasped, her nails digging into his chest as she lost control, her release slamming into her like a tidal wave.Her thighs trembled as she came hard, her body pulsing against his mouth, wetness spilling onto his tongue as he groaned in satisfaction, drinking in every drop.She barely had time to recover before he pulled her down for a searing kiss, his lips slick with her, his grip still firm on her waist.“We’re not done,” he murmured against her mouth, his cock already hard again beneath her.She shivered.But before she could respond, the distant sound of voices drew closer, laughter echoing down the beach.Her eyes widened as she scrambled off him, fixing her dress, her heart hammering.He chuckled, adjusting himself, shaking his head. “You’re lucky they didn’t get any closer.”She smirked, leaning in to whisper against his ear.“You’re lucky I let you cum inside me.”His jaw tightened, his fingers twitching. “You’re gonna pay for that when we get back to the hotel.”She grinned, standing up, brushing sand off her legs before reaching for his hand.“Then what are we waiting for?”And as they made their way back up the beach, the night was far from over.
