Some major things are necessary to keep a relationship healthy. Here are a few I can offer:You should obtain the ability or maturity to resolve conflict without much friction.Employ diplomatic tactics in tense situations, meaning don’t tell your spouse they suck, but that they could get better.Work at it and, believe it or not, having the same interests won’t be too important.But sexual compatibilityisso important—and I don’t think you can really change that. Indeed, sex is the normal driver of couples hitching up, so the more fun you can achieve from this simple activity the better your marriage could hold together.I know there are a lot of long-married couples on MarriageHeat, so please share with us: What other things can we “major in” to help keep our marriages thriving?
