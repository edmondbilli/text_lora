Hello, I am Heather. My husband Steve has submitted a couple of stories, but this is my first.  I am 20 years old and have been married for 8 months.  We were both virgins when we married and also very unknowledgeable and immature about sex.  We were raised in the belief that sex was only for when you were married and making a family. Anything sexual outside of a man on top was degrading, immoral, and sinful, we were taught.Those of us in the younger generation in our small mountain community all talked, and the younger married couples would share their sexual awakenings in private. I was scared but very excited for our wedding night; sex became my obsession, and i couldn’t stop thinking about it. Now that I am married, I can’t stop craving sex.On our honeymoon, neither of us knew exactly what to expect, and we were scared.  We did have sex a few times our first night, and I discovered that enjoyed the size of Steve’s penis. I don’t know if it is comparatively big or not, but it’s just right for me; I can’t get enough of it.That brings me to our issue.  It took a couple of months and many sexual encounters for me to finally experience my first orgasm. It didn’t happen until Steve got comfortable with oral and finger stimulation. He doesn’t have any problem getting a beautiful erection, but he does have issues with having his orgasm fast and with minimal stimulation. He has skirted around the issue in his couple of stories.I’m putting it out there to ask how I can help him accept this and fix it if there is a solution. I love him and would never leave him, but I long to orgasm during sex, to feel his cum shooting into me as my juices release around him. I long to suck his beautiful cock longer. He can go off a few times and does last longer each time, but the longer we go without me having an orgasm, the more I start to get discouraged and lose interest. I feel I’m being a selfish wife.Please, I welcome all advice and direction.
