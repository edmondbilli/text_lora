I know it happens a lot, but I’m afraid of calling it the norm.So, from your experience or perspective, how would you answer these questions?(Singles may also answer if you have some insight or observation.)For couples whose sex life has dwindled or died at some point then resurged to vibrant and spicy, how did you do it? Was there a spark that ignited the change? If so, what was it? Was the resurgence gradual? If so, what changed?For those marriage champions of you who have kept your sex life alive and flourishing, what’s your secret?Thanks in advance for your insight!
