Non-sex days are still a gem‘Cause my wife fixes my problemBy loving on my tiny man nipExcept not todayIt was a holidaySo deep in her mouth went my tipShe was naked and satOn a seat and did patMy testes with her one free handAs deeper she took meThe pleasure it shook meAs she pumped to beat the bandOften she will liftOff of me and shiftSo I’ll cum on her beautiful boobThis time was a rare oneAs she did let me share cumIn her mouth as I drained my cock’s tubeShe swallowed, I surmisedBoy, was I surprisedThat she sucked it down into her tummyI did not complainPleasure blocks out my painAnd my wife had a taste of my cummyT’was not the end of my blissFrom a quite sexy kissI also got some of my cumT’was on Melodie’s lipsAnd some got on her nipsI was happy to both see and taste someIt was Father’s DayWe started with sexy playNo complaints about mi gran regaloA gift like that is funFrom my sexy hun‘Cause we’re married, it’s surely not maloExplanation: Since my wife would rather not make love every day, we have a great compromise. We make love with PIV intercourse every 3 days. On most of the off days, she titillates my man nips with her tongue and lips as she caresses or holds my balls. I then masturbate to orgasm as she loves on (usually) my right nipple.But this poem is about our tradition for holidays: fellatio. Nearly every holiday, my Melodie gives me amazing oral sex. I give her oral more often, but she doesn’t always enjoy it as much as I do. (She can hardly get enough of it sometimes, though.)Sometimes my wife lets me cum inside her mouth, but not usually. I am grateful for the kindness she shows me however or wherever I climax. Because of things from her childhood, she had some aversion to oral sex. But she is getting over the aversion more and more. We negotiated the holiday tradition. And yet sometimes, she’ll surprise me with unscheduled non-holiday oral.We do the “fix my problem” where she stims my nipples as I masturbate on the bed or in the shower or standing in front of our bathroom mirror.This Father’s Day—after I helped my sexy voluptuous wife to step out of the shower/tub—she started in by loving on my man nips. We were both nude in front of the mirror. It’s fun to watch our nude bodies in the mirror. (By the way, I absolutely love the moment she opens the curtains of the shower, and I get to see her shiny wet, beautiful body!)As we were doing this non-intercourse day activity, I remembered that it was Father’s Day, and I reminded my wife. So she sat on the toilet seat and told me to wash up and then she’d get at it. She likes a nice clean erection, and I had not showered yet. So I washed up quickly and stood in front of her between her knees.It was so wonderful. She cocked her head to one side and stroked the base half of my rod while kissing my tip several times. Then she began to pump as she engulfed half my length into her small but sexy mouth. After a while, she needed a break, so I masturbated with my engorged glans only inches from her beautiful face. (There is something incredibly sexy about that.) Then she resumed the fantastic fellatio.We repeated this pattern three or four times. Each round, she gradually took more of me into her mouth and finally got down to using only her thumb and forefinger to pump the base of my rod. She needed another break but then went back to sharing her oral loving gift. As I was inside her mouth the last time, my cock erupted hot cum deep into her mouth.After my orgasm, Melodie stood. Some cum was left on her lower lip, and my last spurt had landed on her breast, right nipple, and tummy, and honestly, it was a cute, sexy, incredibly beautiful sight. She gave me a kiss, and I could taste my cum. We exchanged I love yous, and I added, “ I know you love me or you wouldn’t have just given me THAT incredibly sexy experience!”She smiled, and then I helped her back into the shower to wash off her boobs and tummy. She also rinsed out her mouth, but I noticed that she did not spit out any cum. Once last year, when I came in her mouth, I asked about where the semen went. And she said, “Can’t tell you all my secrets!” so I don’t ask that anymore. But I knew she had to have swallowed. (Kinda sexy to realize that!)I handed her her towel again, and with my help, she exited the shower. I took her hand to steady her.When I said the morning prayer before we left for church that morning, I told the Lord that I was very grateful for Melodie and her willingness to love me that way even though it is not her favorite thing to do. I told Melodie after our prayer that I felt very loved.That was two days ago, but that kind of sexual experience burns into my mind rather permanently with almost all of the details intact. I’ve kept thinking about it since then! When I went to record this nirvana experience in my journal today, it all was still fresh in my mind as if it had just happened; I can’t stop remembering everything about it.While driving around yesterday, I thanked Melodie again. She got her coy smile and said, “You’re welcome.”  She knows that she has upped her game and gotten very skilled at giving me oral love! She takes appropriate pride in her skill.The Spanish words came to mind as I wrote the poem because I’m bilingual. “Gran regalo” means great gift. The word “malo” means bad.Final note: If Melodie just isn’t in the mood to do fellatio on a holiday, I respect her decision. I say a silent prayer and ask God to help me be satisfied and happy about that day’s erotic sharing, and I believe I always get my request. And sooner or later, she’ll make it up to me, or it will be even better on the next holiday.
