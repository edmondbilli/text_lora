In she walked from the back of the roomThe beautiful sight made me swoonBlack bra and short pantyLooking quite fancyJust like on our honeymoonSoon in a sexy danceShe removed the minuscule pantsThen off came the topThought my eyes would popAs she struck a fetching stanceWe first lay in bed nude and talkedOf how a hard childhood we’d walkedOur youths had been roughThe bullies so toughFor me, it was all the cruel jocksI was nerdy and smart, the new kidSports were just not something I didSo they targeted meNever like them I’d beSome were just flat-out PIDPhys-Ed with the football teamMost of them crass and meanThey made fun of my sizeGirth and length you can’t hideI was bigger than them it did seemIn her youth, my wife also was teasedAbout this, she never was pleasedBecause of her breastsLarger than all the restOf the girls’ in her class of P.E.Possessed of a mind that was keenFar smarter than those who were meanOther kids did not seeT’was a good thing to beAn intelligent high school teenOnce a popular boy asked her outBut the guy was just being a loutShe sat down to waitThe advent of her dateBut all she could do was to poutThe dog, he never showed upHe thought he was a real funny pupSo the date was a prank(I think that he stank)He had obviously stood her upFast forward a number of yearsNo longer is my wife in tearsBecause I love her boobsThose kids were such rubesMelodie’s breasts elicit my cheersWe are both known as science geeksSome might think that we are freaksBut our careers were greatSimilar to our mate’sAnd our passion’s still not growing weakSo this morning I loved on each nipI enjoy doing this quite a bitAs I sucked on each nippleHer boobs, they did rippleI also was stroking her clit“That feels really nice!” my wife cooedAs I licked her raspberries like foodNever will those kids knowHow her boobs please me soI am one very grateful dude“I want you inside me!” she pled,As we fondled and cuddled in bed.“Not sucking my tittyNor licking my clitty.Just to feel your engorged head!”“The shaft that’s sporting your glansIs bigger than many a man’s!At least, that’s what I thinkAs I’m on the brinkOf a climax that’s going to be grand!”Soon I entered her tunnel of loveAs I lay upon her from aboveAnd thrust very deepMelodie could not keepfrom crying, “It fits like a glove!”“Your shaft is so deep in my pussy!And your thrusts, they make me so gushy!”Then we each reach the peakWe both cum and she shrieksAs she pulls me close by my tushyWe cuddle and touch, talking moreMelodie is the wife I adoreOf course, she adores meAs I plainly can seeOur arousal again starts to soarI ask, “Do you want a round two?”“That’s of course something I’d like to do!”She says with a kissAnd we enter our blissAs her breasts flush a bright crimson hueI love on her breasts with all mightThey’re a soft, tender, sexy sightAnd they feel really great“I’m so glad you’re my mate!”I say as we soar like a kiteHigh in our sexual passionThat never will go out of fashionLoving me with her bodGiven to me by GodSoon in orgasmic glory, we’re thrashin’“How I love you, my kind, sexy Tom!”She says without one single qualmAs I lay still inside herThen move down beside herI say, “You are really da bomb!”My tough youth defined not my lifeNor did hers my beautiful wifeIn deep love I caressher full Nordic breastsAnd the past seems like no more than trifeAnd cherishes she too MY bodyIncluding my oversized “roddy”Love’s always in bloomOut or inside our roomOur lovemaking’s not too shoddyOf course, our sex life is so greatBecause on each other we waitWe strive to be kindAnd love each other’s mindSo happily married’s our stateOur love is a thing that will lastAs permanent as it is vastWhen we leave mortal stateAnd go through Heaven’s gateTogether we’ll still have a blast—You probably don’t need ‘em, but here are a few definitions based on how the words or phrases are used in this sexy poem:da bomb = the best; the ultimate cool thingPID or pid = stupidtrife = trivialrubes = uneducated & uncultured peopleraspberry = erect or firm nipple due to arousalroddy = rod or erectionpussy = vagina & possibly includes external female genitalia like the clitoris and vulva, etc.clit = clitorisgushy = wet or flowingthrashin’ = thrashing around while lying down—in this case, in orgasmic pleasureNote: This poem is based mostly on fact. It’s meant to point out that if your high school years were awkward and you were bullied, you can still have a successful and happy life, including a spouse that adores you and sees you as beautiful/handsome.This may not be a nice thing to say, but, “A happy life is the best revenge.”  That being said, with God’s help and the power of His Son’s atonement, we have both been able to forgive the bullies of our school years.  And yes, a successful and happy life kind of makes us feel vindicated. As in, “No, we were not the popular kids nor the big shots in school, and we were bullied… but we still have worth in God’s eyes!”You need not be defined by your past. Enduring sexual harassment, abuse of any kind, and being bullied don’t make you less of a person. You are still a child of God. With your own efforts and God’s assistance and guidance, you can heal and become so much more than you were in the past!  I should add that we both got therapy to deal with the rough childhoods we both experienced.  Being bullied at school is only part of what we endured.I want to add that the bullies were the ones who were weak, not you.  And, of course, a loving and passionate marriage in your adult life is certainly not out of the question!  So, we DO feel vindicated.Can any of you relate to this?
