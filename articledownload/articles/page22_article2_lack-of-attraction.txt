Long time lurker, first time poster. I wanted to see if I could get some input from folks on a predicament in which my wife and I have found ourselves. Long story short, since the first day of our marriage, I have not had romantic feelings for my wife nor am I physically attracted to her. Yes, there’s probably a lot of questions as to how one gets into such a marriage, but that’s an extremely long story that I/we are unpacking in therapy.We’ve been married for five years now, and I’ve felt stuck since day one. Just in the past few weeks, this issue of lack of attraction and feelings has bubbled up to the surface after a long time of ignoring these concerns. As two people who are doing our darnedest to follow Jesus, divorce is not an option. Well, to be honest, I’d like it to be an option, but I’m doing my darnedest. To complicate things, we have a 6-month-old son now whom we both dearly love, but obviously just the practical challenges of taking care of children doesn’t make any of this easier.So I really don’t know what to do. I want to be able to find my wife beautiful, but I just don’t. But there’s got to be some way around that, some way to convince myself otherwise that isn’t just me trying to trick myself. Pre-marriage, I had girlfriends to whom I was physically attracted and women I knew that I found generally attractive, but physical attraction was just not in the calculus for my ultimate marriage decision. I really feel this was a mistake on my part, but it’s too late to go back now. Any tips here would be greatly appreciated.
