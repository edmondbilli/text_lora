I recently saw a funny video where a husband was explaining to his wife the origin of the “G-spot”.  The husband said, “So, God had just created man, and He was creating woman.  He decides, ‘Okay, I’m going to put this one spot WAY deep in the vagina. And it’s going to take work to reach it. But when the guy reaches it, that’ll be My spot.  The woman will yell My name because she’s going to enjoy it so much.  I’ll call it the ‘God-spot’.”  It was of course humorous, but I was thinking…it’s true! Is it something that God did on purpose to wire our bodies and brains this way? So that when we’re so overloaded with pleasure, an acknowledgment of His existence and creation is wrenched out of us? I mean, even atheists use God’s name, both in bed and out of it.Now, it occurred to me that there is no exception to the command to not take God’s name in vain. Thinking about it, I feared that I had become lax since I had consider spicy language to be okay. And that includes saying ‘oh my God’ during sex or masturbation.  However, the G-spot joke made me second-guess my worrying.  Perhaps after all it is actually that we are praising God, whether we mean to or not.  As Christians, we can mean it.  We SHOULD mean it!So, I decided I would try to purposefully make that exclamation (during self-pleasure times) a meaningful one.  Even if I am out of my mind with pleasure, I don’t want to use God’s name lightly or crudely.  I want to keep in my mind that I am voicing the name of my Creator and Savior. I shouldn’t be loose about that.  Of course, He gave us this awesome gift of sexuality. It only makes sense we would yell His name in gratitude as we enjoy the sensations it brings.Would you all share your thoughts on this topic?
