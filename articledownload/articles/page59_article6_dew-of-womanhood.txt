As I grow in my understanding of my body and being and delve deeper into my sexuality, I find more to enjoy and praise God for.Â  Only He could bring about the change Iâ€™ve experienced in my views of certain things.One is sexual fluid.Â  I now see it as one of the sexiest things about myself.Â  (I enjoy trying to read my cycle signs and walking around with the moisture of mucus dampening my underwear).Â  When I masturbate, I get really wet.A couple weeks ago, I was using my vibrator like a dildo, as I generally do, and every time I pulled it out, a big drip of creamy dew would slide out of my vagina.Â  I was leaning against my bed in front of the mirror so I could enjoy the view, and boy, that was a hot sight! I immediately imagined it was my future husbandâ€™s semen leaking out of me.Â  That just made me rub and plow into my cunt more wildly.Â  Iâ€™m very grateful for such abundant arousal juices.Another thing is my scent.Â  I know that women can be self-conscious about that, but as long as it isnâ€™t putrid or fishy, itâ€™s normal and natural and shouldnâ€™t be masked with perfumes or scented soaps.Â  I started taking a couple of supplements recently, and right away I noticed that my vaginal scent (and taste ðŸ˜‰) was sweeter and more pungent, to the point where I really like it.Â  I never have.Â  I always thought it tooâ€¦ fleshy? For anyone wondering, I definitely keep it clean down there, but itâ€™s impossible to rid that area completely of urine and sweat smells, so that turned me off.Â  Now, though, I find it more natural.Â  And if the supplements are contributing to this better aroma, I will keep that up.All this to say that a womanâ€™s dew (I love that word) is beautiful and sweet and even delicious.Â  I am embracing that, and I am so glad that I have that mindset now.Â  Hopefully I will someday marry a guy who will also love the taste and scent of my dew.What about you, MHers? Do you like the smell and taste of your/your wives secretions? Has that changed over time, and why?
