Hey guys, I have something I want to get off my chest. My church had a singles night where I was quite shocked at the event. Most of the attendees are in their 20s and 30s and they’ve already had sex. I kind of feel left out, and I feel that it is not fair that I have to wait—that other people get to have sex and I don’t. I’m angry and hurt and feel betrayed by my biblical teachings. Any advice?
