Hello all!I am an early twenties female, married for about a year. Some additionally context is I have some mild health issues/fatigue so I experience reduced physical arousal but very mentally interested/theoretically sexually adventurous. While my husband does a *great job* and is very sensitive to my needs, I am having some issues with orgasms on my end:I find having enough energy to orgasm difficult. I have full body muscular/core engagement (almost clenching) and shaking when building up to orgasm, and if it takes awhile for everything to build and I have to be in that in the intermediate stage  (muscles shaking/contracting but no orgasm), it can be exhausting to the point I need him to quitbefore getting there. I have capabilities for multiples with him using faster methods (e.g. shower head, sometimes oral), but it can be exhausting to try to get there generally so any advice is welcome.I haven’t been able to feel a lot when he goes inside me. It’s gently pleasant, but want to increase the ability to develop vaginal orgasm or at least pleasure (I know less common but any tips to develop that would be super helpful). We have successfully done g spot with his hands once.Also since we are newly married, any tips you wish you’d know are welcome!
