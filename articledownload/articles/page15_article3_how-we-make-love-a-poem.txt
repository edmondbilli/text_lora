How We Make LoveThis poem is written to you loving wifeYou’re clearly the love of my lifeYou’re sexy and kindWith a brilliant mindWe’ve a marriage of peace and not strifeBut it’s also a marriage of deep passionThat we share in our unique sexy fashionAs a virgin you soon learnedHow to make my body burnAnd how with your body to sexually cash inBefore kissing we were both best friendsEach other’s broken heart we did mendOur marriage has been greatYour my friend and my mateOur love for each other will never endYour beauty still takes my breath awayWith big eyes and curvy body for my playAnd your mind is so cleverI’ll love you foreverOur love and marriage is here to stayYou had felt lonely and asked God for a friendAnd I needed my shattered heart to mendI became a friend that was trueAnd my heart you did wooIn fact by you my heart was pennedYour sweet kisses really take the cakeThey are passionate real and not fakeThey show your love for meI could not happier beAs we proceed with the love we will makeNext is each rounded full boobyThey are so adorable to meEach nipple’s a raspberryAnd both are so very veryLike a soft form of a precious rubyI really love licking your pussyMaking you wet and all gushyYour taste is divineI’m so glad that you’re mineYou also have a very cute tushyWhen monthly my big dick you do blowI feel so loved and I love you back soSo much ecstasyI thought I’d never seeOr feel, but you are my sexy doeGetting into your pussy can be trickyAs I can have an uncooperative dickySo on your left boob I’ll focusI’ll soon see that you woke usAs me and my cock have gotten ready quicklyThen full intercourse is an absolute mustAs into your sweet pussy I strongly thrustThe pleasure’s indescribableLike Proverbs 5 in the BibleAs I rejoice at the view of your bouncing bustBut sometimes you kneel on the bedI’ll feed your pussy my turgid cock’s headI’ll pound you from behindAnd you really don’t mind“It’s my favorite position!” you’ve saidBut THIS poem is about our X positionAs we are in a perpendicular conditionI lay on my sideYour legs are opened wideThis has become our favorite sex traditionI’m rejoicing with the wife of my youthCome to think of it that’s not quite the truthYou were close to fourtyI was close to thirtyBut to us our love was not uncouthNow back to our lovemaking fashionFull of love and sexual passionAs I thrust in and outThere is clearly no doubtOur bed is our romantic bastionI feel my approaching ecstasyOf a climax as large as the seaThe sensations are unrealI’m so amazed I can feelSuch love and passion that are surrounding meThen I move to your left boob againI latch onto that tit that’s a tenYou buzz your clit with your vibeAnd you feel very aliveYour orgasm’s a place of erotic ZenWe then cuddle immersed in our deepest loveSo supremely blessed by our God up aboveWe are in our love nestWhich for us is bestYou are my beautiful pure white sexy doveWhite doves are often released at weddingsAs the new bride and groom exchange the ringsYou are pure and you’re sweetFrom your head to your feetI’m so glad that you’re my Queen and I’m KingKing and Queen of our faith-filled loving homeYet often the wide world we like to roamMaking love in each landOur love’s flame is fannedLove memories are what led to this poemWe’ve had fun making love on each cruiseI love hearing your deep sighs and coosAs you arch your backAs in pleasure you’re wrappedIn orgasmic shocks and deep truthsThe deep truths are that God loves us a tonBecause he gave us His Beloved SonAnd he gave us each otherEach to be friend and loverAnd together life’s race we still run
