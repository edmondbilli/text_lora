Scripture can seem sort of quiet on virginity. Where older parents tell children, “Just don’t do it,” or “Just stay away from it,” the younger crowd is curious. This is the age-old dynamic:How close to the edge can I get without sinning? Many people experiment with sexual boundaries, while the Bible and church stress abstinence.Some would say that Bible times would equal stronger, more chaste, people than today. But, then again, we can disagree. All the while, our own sexual habits, experiences and beliefs influence our standards and conclusions very heavily. Sometimes we recognize this, other times we don’t.So, I’d like to ask you all, knowing we could all have a different answer……What is a virgin?Almost no one would ever say a doctor’s exam of the vagina would equate a loss of virginity. Some may debate whether masturbation equals a loss of virginity. What about toys?What lines have to be crossed before a woman knows she technically should not wear white at her wedding? Some believers have homosexual play in their past—would that be a loss of virginity? For men’s virginity, is it about going into a vagina, or about going into anything? What if he doesn’t cum? What if he only had the tip in and changed his mind?Is the Bible clear enough? Should we know better? Are we playing God with people’s virginity? Is it any and all sexual contact, or just intercourse that concerns virginity?Opine, please. But as you opine, consider this hypothetical scenario.Say, at any age, a girl is getting married. She has been naked with other guys. She has been felt up, has been fingered, done anal sex, and has been eaten out, all in consenting encounters, and to her pleasure. She has masturbated to orgasm, hashad as many orgasms, experiences, and partners. Basically, she has had everything in her vagina, but a penis. She has never had vaginal intercourse.Now, her to-be-husband asks if she is a virgin. Technically, literally, honest before God, what does she answer?
