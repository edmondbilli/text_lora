The aim of this game is for the wife to receive a lot of pleasure and orgasms from her husband… and the husband might receive something in return to reward his efforts.This game is comprised of two parts:Part 1:The wife gets naked and comfortable. The husband then has 1 hour to give the wife as many orgasms as he can, starting from when he touches her for the first time. The husband can use whatever means he wishes to bring the wife to orgasm, within the limits of what is comfortable for her, and bearing in mind that the idea is to focus on her pleasure. The wife is, of course, free to make suggestions and requests. Because this is supposed to be a fun game, when the time expires, the husband may finish giving the wife any orgasm he was ‘working on’ at the time.Part 2:Have the wife roll a six-sided die. The wife should remain naked for one hour per pip per orgasm: for example, if she had four orgasms and rolls a three, she should remain naked for twelve hours. If she rolls a six, she should roll again and add the two numbers together. If she rolls asecondsix, round up to one day naked per orgasm. If the resulting naked time is a very long period, it can be split up into multiple smaller chunks, or you can challenge yourself to find a way to do it all at once!Variations and Ideas:You can vary the duration of the game and/or the time spent naked by the wife to suit your circumstances/preferences.You could give the husband a different ‘reward’ per pip per orgasm instead of (or even in addition to!) the wife being naked.If the wife breaks her record for most number of orgasms in a session, or exceeds some pre-determined number of orgasms, the husband has his reward enhanced in some way that both spouses decide.Hope you enjoy playing this game!
