After reading one of LovingManâ€™s comments recently, I thought Iâ€™d just put the question out there:Married couples â€“ What is your favorite sex position and why?Patiently waiting singles â€“ What might your favorite position be with your future spouse, and why?To play fair, Iâ€™ll go first.When romance is in the air, itâ€™s missionary. I love the eye contact, the full view and access to all her parts. And I love when she wraps her legs around me in an effort to pull me in.When thereâ€™s just a naughty need, itâ€™s doggy. Thereâ€™s something primal and animalistic about taking her from behind. The view is also spectacular and it gives me access to her other tight little canal. ðŸ˜‰So now itâ€™s your turn, fellow MHers.
