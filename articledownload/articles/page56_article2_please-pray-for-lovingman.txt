Hello, dear MHers. LovingMan and his Melody had a health scare last night that led to his immediate admittance to hospital. His regular doctor has scheduled him for emergency surgery tomorrow.He told me that both he and Melody have received comfort from the Holy Spirit as to this incident. He’s requesting prayers from his “MH family of friends” that his “kind of scary” surgery would go well and that he’ll be released after a couple of days of recovery as planned.Would you please join me in praying for Lovingman and his wife, family, doctors, and other caregivers? He believes deeply in the power of prayer (as do I) and will benefit greatly from your comments and encouragement before heading into the operating room.Love in Christ,Missy
