This is GG. My husband Ben is currently in the hospital after suffering two heart attacks. The first one came as he was mowing the yard. The Second one happened at the hospital. They said that his ” Widow maker” was 80 percent blocked and that if he hadn’t been in the hospital when it happened, he wouldn’t have made it.Currently he is in ICU after they put two stints in. He is doing OK. We are very fortunate that he is still with us. Not totally out of the woods yet, but things are turning towards the better. Just going to need plenty of rest. I would like to ask my MH family for their prayers. This isn’t the easiest thing for me to write, but I know that our Lord and Savior will pull him through.Thank you and God bless you all!❤️ Gina G.
